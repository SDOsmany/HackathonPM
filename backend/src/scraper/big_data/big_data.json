While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass.

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development. What problems we have been thinking about and the mission of our efforts is to help users participate in DeFi more quickly and conveniently.\n\n\nWhat's the next for Soapy Finance\n\n\nAccording to the roadmap, we will focus on product development.\n\n\n\n\n Product Development\n\n\n Users growths and community building\n\n\n Fundraising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nes\njava\nobjective-c\npython\nredis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoapy.finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napy.top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter.com"

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

We did it at the beginning of the project with an airdrop of the SAIL max Supply. We will open-sourced all our developments and coming development. \n\n\n## What it does\n\nFirst part of the project is our TipSailBot for Discord. It's a simple and easy to use bot which allow any discord members of a server(with a specific role) to tip and receive tips. Because it will be open-sourced any team who built on Solana can update and use it for their discord/SPL token. The only 'SolanaSail' we included inside the code is a requirement of 1 SAIL and 1 gSAIL to be able to tip other discord members.\n\n\n## How we built it\n\nUsing Node.js,  web3.js\n\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe main challenge was to not store the user private keys on file or database, reason why at each bot restart the user need to re-import his private key or register a new tipsailbot wallet.\n\n\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\n\nTipSailBot users get their private keys from the bot when he register a new tipsailbot wallet, then this private key could be imported in a Phantom, Sollet, C98, MathWallet.... That way the user has control on his tipsailbot wallet. We do not store on file or database the private keys.\n\n\n## What we learned\n\nThe most sensible security part is the import-wallet, members has to import private keys by DM the tipsailbot and for that reason we have restricted and encouraged to restrict the usage of this command to discord specific roles(setup in the config file).\n\n\nWhat's next for SolanaSail\n\n\nCompletion of our tipsailbot integration in our discord battleship game(on going). Then after more playtoearn game could be developed(Poker, BlackJack....), the governance DAO will proposed and decide.\nA governance DAO platform using part of Mango DAO Governance code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndiscord.js\nnode.js\nweb3.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscord.gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

To achieve it's full potential, bitcoin needs to be accessible and easy to use. Millions of vending machines are used on a daily basis. Enabling vending machines across the world with an approachable way to accept bitcoin payments is our vision of an effective way to help achieve worldwide adoption.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nOur project is a vue.js application that connects an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine to the Bitcoin Lightning Network for receiving payments via the opennode API.\n\n\n\n\nThis app is a payment UI running on a secure tablet connected to an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine.\n\n\nThe app's simple to use and intuitive interface makes the Bitcoin Lightning Network more user friendly and approachable.\n\n\nThe app connects to the OpenNode Lightning API to create a payment invoice.\n\n\nWhen the invoice is paid, it notifies the CryptoVend of the payment.\n\n\nThe vending machine receives the credit notification and then will dispense product once the user makes their desired selection.\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Installation\n\n\nThe following are the steps to run your own Lightning Network enabled vending machine:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the iozeta CryptoVend device into an MDB capable vending machine.\n\n\nFollow instructions at \nhttps://github.com/iozeta/cryptovend-tablet-ui\n\n\nConnect a tablet to the same WiFi internet network as the vending machine.\n\n\nStart the app on your tablet.\n\n\nTap the \"Tap to Start\" button.\n\n\nScan the QR code to send a Bitcoin Lightning Network payment.\n\n\nMake item selection to dispense the desired product from the vending machine.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nDetermining how to connect to the Lightning Network on an Android tablet in a robust and reliable way was the most significant challenge we faced. We found that the opennode API was both robust and reliable -- opennode was also very intuitive, making it relatively easy to implement.

Since we are already maintaining a community, the need for our app to support wallets in multiple platforms is essential. We need to be very flexible on making changes and make the app highly maintainable to adapts the rapid developing of Solana ecosystems.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe have already launched the beta version of project just one week before the submission and there is already community of users successfully stake, claim, and made withdrawals via our Vue web app. There are problems on staking and viewing staking information on the first days of launching, and we managed to solve all the issue just in one day. \n\n\nCompared to existing on-chain timelock staking app, we featured a simpler UI/UX to stake, claim rewards and withdraws, all staking information such as user balance, total user staked, total user claimable and pending withdrawals are viewable in a glances.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nBeing the first project we ever launched, we have learnt to use solana ecosystem tools, command lines and library to deploy our first program and built.\n\n\n\n\nsolana web3\n\n\nserum\n\n\nsolana wallet adapter\n\n\nanchor\n\n\nsolana cli\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for OXS Timelock Staking App\n\n\nWe'll constantly monitor the app for any security and performance issues, integrate with more wallets, understand users' behaviour and provide more staking metrics and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nserum\nsolana\nvue\nweb3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking-oxs.oxbull.tech"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Most protocols target pro investors and leave out regular banking users.  \n\n\nAs a group of ex-pats from Latin American countries that have gone through dictatorships, communism, massive inflation, and economic stagnation for decades, we feel crypto and defi are the only way forward for us and the rest of the world.  \n\n\nThis is a race for freedom. To win it fast we need to bring everybody else for this ride, not only the cyberpunks, and the developers, and the traders, and the investors... but also the moms, dads, kids, and workers moving billions of dollars in remittances, payroll, recurring savings for school and retirement accounts.  \n\n\nThis is why we are building MeanFi, it has a very powerful double bottom line of doing good while doing well for everyone involved. We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route.

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "Genopets - The World's First Move-to-Earn NFT Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Genoverse map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSelecting a destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe step challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAugment system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\nThe idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to use a health data marketplace to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay active. While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass.

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development. What problems we have been thinking about and the mission of our efforts is to help users participate in DeFi more quickly and conveniently.\n\n\nWhat's the next for Soapy Finance\n\n\nAccording to the roadmap, we will focus on product development.\n\n\n\n\n Product Development\n\n\n Users growths and community building\n\n\n Fundraising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nes\njava\nobjective-c\npython\nredis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoapy.finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napy.top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter.com"

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

To achieve it's full potential, bitcoin needs to be accessible and easy to use. Millions of vending machines are used on a daily basis. Enabling vending machines across the world with an approachable way to accept bitcoin payments is our vision of an effective way to help achieve worldwide adoption.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nOur project is a vue.js application that connects an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine to the Bitcoin Lightning Network for receiving payments via the opennode API.\n\n\n\n\nThis app is a payment UI running on a secure tablet connected to an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine.\n\n\nThe app's simple to use and intuitive interface makes the Bitcoin Lightning Network more user friendly and approachable.\n\n\nThe app connects to the OpenNode Lightning API to create a payment invoice.\n\n\nWhen the invoice is paid, it notifies the CryptoVend of the payment.\n\n\nThe vending machine receives the credit notification and then will dispense product once the user makes their desired selection.\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Installation\n\n\nThe following are the steps to run your own Lightning Network enabled vending machine:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the iozeta CryptoVend device into an MDB capable vending machine.\n\n\nFollow instructions at \nhttps://github.com/iozeta/cryptovend-tablet-ui\n\n\nConnect a tablet to the same WiFi internet network as the vending machine.\n\n\nStart the app on your tablet.\n\n\nTap the \"Tap to Start\" button.\n\n\nScan the QR code to send a Bitcoin Lightning Network payment.\n\n\nMake item selection to dispense the desired product from the vending machine.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nDetermining how to connect to the Lightning Network on an Android tablet in a robust and reliable way was the most significant challenge we faced. We found that the opennode API was both robust and reliable -- opennode was also very intuitive, making it relatively easy to implement.

Withdrawals can be made after a predefined period of time.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe program is using Solana Web3 and Vue.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nRapid development of Solana ecosystems forces our development to be built on a very fast pace. Since we are already maintaining a community, the need for our app to support wallets in multiple platforms is essential. We need to be very flexible on making changes and make the app highly maintainable to adapts the rapid developing of Solana ecosystems.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe have already launched the beta version of project just one week before the submission and there is already community of users successfully stake, claim, and made withdrawals via our Vue web app. There are problems on staking and viewing staking information on the first days of launching, and we managed to solve all the issue just in one day. \n\n\nCompared to existing on-chain timelock staking app, we featured a simpler UI/UX to stake, claim rewards and withdraws, all staking information such as user balance, total user staked, total user claimable and pending withdrawals are viewable in a glances.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nBeing the first project we ever launched, we have learnt to use solana ecosystem tools, command lines and library to deploy our first program and built.\n\n\n\n\nsolana web3\n\n\nserum\n\n\nsolana wallet adapter\n\n\nanchor\n\n\nsolana cli\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for OXS Timelock Staking App\n\n\nWe'll constantly monitor the app for any security and performance issues, integrate with more wallets, understand users' behaviour and provide more staking metrics and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nserum\nsolana\nvue\nweb3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking-oxs.oxbull.tech"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time. \n\n\n\n\nHow I built it\n\n\nI started building the app by first drawing the mockups or rough sketches on paper.

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

        "content": "[CASE STUDY] : Urban Reality - The Elevation of Perfection\n\n\nProject Overview:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a residential real estate company dedicated to creating one-of-a-kind homes that perfectly suit their client's lifestyle & this project is the \nCMS and CRM\n of Urban Reality's web app.\n\n\nIn the era of the internet it is mandatory for each and every one to have their presence or footprint on the internet to keep  pace with the advanced technology and cope up with the market hence I have created this complete solution for residential real estate and our company Urban Reality. The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "Genopets - The World's First Move-to-Earn NFT Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Genoverse map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSelecting a destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe step challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAugment system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\nThe idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to use a health data marketplace to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay active. While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass. Work carried out even he was immobilized on hospital bed. \n\n\nFinished UI design v2, working on v3, working toward internal test end Oct and MVP end Nov.\n\n\nComplete seed round with 3 times over subscription, investors are all tier-1 investment firms, both crypto native and traditional funds. \n\n\nHave advisors from game, running app and blockchain industries to help us refine the product.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nA good game producer can save a lot of time and head scratching (lucky we have one with 15 years experience). \n\n\nDon\u2019t exercise right after eating.\n\n\nGive project a good name is very hard work (still working on it)\n\n\nDon\u2019t start pitching capitals until the team find what is the real pain point or sweat spot. \n\n\nA good Game-Fi project must be a good game first, a smooth-running application second, and has a tokenomic that makes sense third.  \n\n\nSometime focusing too much on the nitty gritty makes you lose perspective; we need constantly tell ourselves what is our vision and stop tunnel vision on things.\n\n\nWhat's next for Find Satoshi\n\n\nFinish private round and release MVP in Nov, use fund raised to get 1 million non-crypto players before the end of this year. \n\n\n24th Oct Update\n \n\n\nv2.o working demo is available for testing, feature include:\nGPS tracking fuction;\nLevel up sneaker;\nMystery Box looting;\nBetter user account interface;\nBetter sneaker detail page;\nSimplified version of wallet.\n\n\nv2.0 demo video: \nhttps://youtu.be/-0nS-ZtJmkU\n\n\nAddressing to judging criteria\n\n\nPotential Impact\n\nStepN has potential to bring tenth of million new users to solana ecosystem through funneling runners to crypto player.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\nThe project is in alpha testing and we will start public beta testing within a week.\n\n\nNovelty\nThere is no move2earn game on mobile devices other than ours.\n\n\nDesign\nWe have several well experienced game developer and UI/UX designer working on this proejct.\n\n\nGo-to-market Strategy\nWe will start from building crypto community before the full product releases to the market, after the full product release, we will focus on non-crypto runners and leverage main stream media on the topic of carbon reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\namazon-web-services\njava\njavascript\nlinux\nmysql\nnode.js\nrust\nsolidity\ntypescript"

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development. What problems we have been thinking about and the mission of our efforts is to help users participate in DeFi more quickly and conveniently.\n\n\nWhat's the next for Soapy Finance\n\n\nAccording to the roadmap, we will focus on product development.\n\n\n\n\n Product Development\n\n\n Users growths and community building\n\n\n Fundraising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nes\njava\nobjective-c\npython\nredis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoapy.finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napy.top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter.com"

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "MeanFi - the most amazing and simple DeFi experience on Solana \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nDEMO VIDEO\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nPRESENTATION\n\n\nThe promise of DeFi: \nTo bank and invest without a trusted central counterparty\n has not been fulfilled yet. Most protocols target pro investors and leave out regular banking users.  \n\n\nAs a group of ex-pats from Latin American countries that have gone through dictatorships, communism, massive inflation, and economic stagnation for decades, we feel crypto and defi are the only way forward for us and the rest of the world.  \n\n\nThis is a race for freedom. To win it fast we need to bring everybody else for this ride, not only the cyberpunks, and the developers, and the traders, and the investors... but also the moms, dads, kids, and workers moving billions of dollars in remittances, payroll, recurring savings for school and retirement accounts.  \n\n\nThis is why we are building MeanFi, it has a very powerful double bottom line of doing good while doing well for everyone involved. We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time. \n\n\n\n\nHow I built it\n\n\nI started building the app by first drawing the mockups or rough sketches on paper. After designing came the part of development. For backend I used firebase. For version control system, I used github and whole source code of this app is present on my github repository.  \n\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\n\nBeing the only developer for such a large project, I had to manage my time efficiently. From designing to developing to testing. I did it all. Time management was the biggest challenge that I faced.\n\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\n\nThe modules that I made when started working properly gave me the biggest sense of accomplishment. I used various students of my college for testing purpose, and they were \n\n\nWhat I learned\n\n\nWhile making this project I learned the concepts of firebase as a backend, and how to do testing with the help of firebase.  \n\n\nWhat's next for TRAVIS-Traffic Realtime Assistant Via Internet Service\n\n\nIn future prospects, I want to integrate Internet of thing technology (IoT) with my app to provide real-time instant notification in case of a traffic accident. This notification will reach to the nearby police station, hospital and relatives of the person. \nI would also like to integrate machine learning algorithms to improve the quality of traffic feed and make it more relevant to the users based on their locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\nglide\nphotoshop\nvoll\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.dropbox.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.behance.net"

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "Genopets - The World's First Move-to-Earn NFT Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Genoverse map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSelecting a destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe step challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAugment system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\nThe idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to use a health data marketplace to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay active. While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out.

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development. What problems we have been thinking about and the mission of our efforts is to help users participate in DeFi more quickly and conveniently.\n\n\nWhat's the next for Soapy Finance\n\n\nAccording to the roadmap, we will focus on product development.\n\n\n\n\n Product Development\n\n\n Users growths and community building\n\n\n Fundraising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nes\njava\nobjective-c\npython\nredis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoapy.finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napy.top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter.com"

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "MeanFi - the most amazing and simple DeFi experience on Solana \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nDEMO VIDEO\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nPRESENTATION\n\n\nThe promise of DeFi: \nTo bank and invest without a trusted central counterparty\n has not been fulfilled yet. Most protocols target pro investors and leave out regular banking users.  \n\n\nAs a group of ex-pats from Latin American countries that have gone through dictatorships, communism, massive inflation, and economic stagnation for decades, we feel crypto and defi are the only way forward for us and the rest of the world.  \n\n\nThis is a race for freedom. To win it fast we need to bring everybody else for this ride, not only the cyberpunks, and the developers, and the traders, and the investors... but also the moms, dads, kids, and workers moving billions of dollars in remittances, payroll, recurring savings for school and retirement accounts.  \n\n\nThis is why we are building MeanFi, it has a very powerful double bottom line of doing good while doing well for everyone involved. We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time. \n\n\n\n\nHow I built it\n\n\nI started building the app by first drawing the mockups or rough sketches on paper. After designing came the part of development. For backend I used firebase. For version control system, I used github and whole source code of this app is present on my github repository.  \n\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\n\nBeing the only developer for such a large project, I had to manage my time efficiently. From designing to developing to testing. I did it all. Time management was the biggest challenge that I faced.\n\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\n\nThe modules that I made when started working properly gave me the biggest sense of accomplishment. I used various students of my college for testing purpose, and they were \n\n\nWhat I learned\n\n\nWhile making this project I learned the concepts of firebase as a backend, and how to do testing with the help of firebase.  \n\n\nWhat's next for TRAVIS-Traffic Realtime Assistant Via Internet Service\n\n\nIn future prospects, I want to integrate Internet of thing technology (IoT) with my app to provide real-time instant notification in case of a traffic accident. This notification will reach to the nearby police station, hospital and relatives of the person. \nI would also like to integrate machine learning algorithms to improve the quality of traffic feed and make it more relevant to the users based on their locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\nglide\nphotoshop\nvoll\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.dropbox.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.behance.net"

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "Genopets - The World's First Move-to-Earn NFT Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Genoverse map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSelecting a destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe step challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAugment system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\nThe idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to use a health data marketplace to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay active. While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass. Work carried out even he was immobilized on hospital bed. \n\n\nFinished UI design v2, working on v3, working toward internal test end Oct and MVP end Nov.\n\n\nComplete seed round with 3 times over subscription, investors are all tier-1 investment firms, both crypto native and traditional funds. \n\n\nHave advisors from game, running app and blockchain industries to help us refine the product.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nA good game producer can save a lot of time and head scratching (lucky we have one with 15 years experience). \n\n\nDon\u2019t exercise right after eating.\n\n\nGive project a good name is very hard work (still working on it)\n\n\nDon\u2019t start pitching capitals until the team find what is the real pain point or sweat spot. \n\n\nA good Game-Fi project must be a good game first, a smooth-running application second, and has a tokenomic that makes sense third.  \n\n\nSometime focusing too much on the nitty gritty makes you lose perspective; we need constantly tell ourselves what is our vision and stop tunnel vision on things.\n\n\nWhat's next for Find Satoshi\n\n\nFinish private round and release MVP in Nov, use fund raised to get 1 million non-crypto players before the end of this year. \n\n\n24th Oct Update\n \n\n\nv2.o working demo is available for testing, feature include:\nGPS tracking fuction;\nLevel up sneaker;\nMystery Box looting;\nBetter user account interface;\nBetter sneaker detail page;\nSimplified version of wallet.\n\n\nv2.0 demo video: \nhttps://youtu.be/-0nS-ZtJmkU\n\n\nAddressing to judging criteria\n\n\nPotential Impact\n\nStepN has potential to bring tenth of million new users to solana ecosystem through funneling runners to crypto player.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\nThe project is in alpha testing and we will start public beta testing within a week.\n\n\nNovelty\nThere is no move2earn game on mobile devices other than ours.\n\n\nDesign\nWe have several well experienced game developer and UI/UX designer working on this proejct.\n\n\nGo-to-market Strategy\nWe will start from building crypto community before the full product releases to the market, after the full product release, we will focus on non-crypto runners and leverage main stream media on the topic of carbon reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\namazon-web-services\njava\njavascript\nlinux\nmysql\nnode.js\nrust\nsolidity\ntypescript"

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets.

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The intimation about the request will be sent to all registered donors if any of the donor accepts to donate, then crutch provides them an option to chose Volunteer assistance .if he chooses volunteer service the crutch volunteer will help in delivering the requirement from donor to recipient at right time. Thereby crutch feed the needy people at right time. Crutch  has verification team to ensure that details submitted by recipient doesn't contain any false information.\n\n\nCrutch Functionality\n\n\nThe crutch has 6 services apart from registration & Volunteer Survey & Feed the Need.The following is the detailed description of all case type.\n\n\n1)Registration:\n    The customer can sign in in to crutch application via registration case type. He has to specify his role type(donor/recipient) & service type(6 services) based on which the work group & workbaskets are assigned for them.They can change role type in future as well.After providing the preliminary details such as personal info,Organisation info(if he/she representing any org) & address details.After the approval by the admin crutch the access credentials are created for the customer.The case will not move to approval unless he accept terms & conditions of crutch .\nInnovation:\nWe have implemented completion status- Progress bar for the customer to track his registration completion status\n\n\n2)Feed The Need:\n   The purpose of this case type is to help the needy people in choosing the service according to their need.\nSix exclusive services are shown to customer on their next login where he/she can choose one and proceed with flow.\n\n\nInnovation: Six attractive icons are configured where the user clicks the Icon the corresponding case type begins.\n\n\n3)Crutch Pay:\n    The purpose of this case type is to donate/receive money .The recipient begins the case where he views all his details in editable format .They can edit it if necessary.The  customer can raise money request for his own self or for his friend/relatives.In case of friend/relative .He has to provide their details.There are few predefined reasons present for requesting money such as requesting fund for orphanage/home, requesting fund for natural calamity,,requesting for illness/Accident .Customer can also provide his own reason of requesting by choosing others.He has to provide all the required info along with necessary documents.He will also specify his preferred timing for help.After his submission,there happens background verification process by crutch admin where all details are checked. The case proceeds forward only if details are true. Then on the successful completion of verification the intimation will be sent to all donors if any donors accepts he can confirm his own details and move for payment. Method of Payment can also be Negotiated by donor if he is comfortable with.After receiving the money the recipient fills the fullfilment and provide feedback.\n\n\nInnovation:Modal dialog -Pop up for thanking the customer\n\n\n4)Food Service:\n  The donor /Recipient can begin the case by providing the Food details.If recipient begins the case it moves to donor for viewing the recipient details and if he accepts the request then it moves to gather delivery information.There the recipient has an option of requesting any volunteer service then the case routes to volunteer workbasket if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\nIf the donor begins the case he provides the details of donating food,the case routes to recipient workbasket .\nThe recipient has an option of selecting self or volunteer service .If he goes for volunteer service ,then it routes to volunteer workbasket.if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\n\n\n5)Cloth Service:\n               The donor /Recipient can begin the case by providing the Food details.If recipient begins the case it moves to donor for viewing the recipient details and if he accepts the request then it moves to gather delivery information.There the recipient has an option of requesting any volunteer service then the case routes to \nvolunteer workbasket if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.If the donor begins the case he provides the details of donating cloth.the case routes to recipient workbasket .The recipient has an option of selecting self or volunteer service .If he goes for volunteer service ,then it routes to volunteer workbasket.if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\n\n\n6)Education Service:\n   The recipient begins the case where he has the option to acts as referencer or self based on type of request he raise. If he is raising for him he can provide as self, if not he can act as referencer. He gives all his preliminary details & attach Necessary Documents.Then the case move forwards to background verification Process. \nUnless the background verification successfully completes the case does not move forward .On Successful completion ,it routes to donor workbasket.If any of the donor accept to provide contact details are shared with both.Then fulfillment details are received from recipient after receiving the help.\n\n\n7)Share Blood:\n   This case type can be accessed by donor/Recipient.If donor begins the case he can donate the blood by Providing  all the necessary details .If in case of recipient begins the case ,he has two options either he can view the already donated blood details which matches his requirements or he can raise a new request.After his submission of request the case move forwards to donor where he can accept the request & confirm his details and also assist for volunteer service..thus,with help of volunteer support requirements are delivered from donor to recipient.\n\n\n8)Share Organ:\n    This case type can be accessed by donor/Recipient.If donor begins the case he need to provide his details If he had his organ registration certificate he need to attach it then the admin will review.

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "MeanFi - the most amazing and simple DeFi experience on Solana \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nDEMO VIDEO\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nPRESENTATION\n\n\nThe promise of DeFi: \nTo bank and invest without a trusted central counterparty\n has not been fulfilled yet. Most protocols target pro investors and leave out regular banking users.  \n\n\nAs a group of ex-pats from Latin American countries that have gone through dictatorships, communism, massive inflation, and economic stagnation for decades, we feel crypto and defi are the only way forward for us and the rest of the world.  \n\n\nThis is a race for freedom. To win it fast we need to bring everybody else for this ride, not only the cyberpunks, and the developers, and the traders, and the investors... but also the moms, dads, kids, and workers moving billions of dollars in remittances, payroll, recurring savings for school and retirement accounts.  \n\n\nThis is why we are building MeanFi, it has a very powerful double bottom line of doing good while doing well for everyone involved. We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time. \n\n\n\n\nHow I built it\n\n\nI started building the app by first drawing the mockups or rough sketches on paper. After designing came the part of development. For backend I used firebase. For version control system, I used github and whole source code of this app is present on my github repository.  \n\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\n\nBeing the only developer for such a large project, I had to manage my time efficiently. From designing to developing to testing. I did it all. Time management was the biggest challenge that I faced.\n\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\n\nThe modules that I made when started working properly gave me the biggest sense of accomplishment. I used various students of my college for testing purpose, and they were \n\n\nWhat I learned\n\n\nWhile making this project I learned the concepts of firebase as a backend, and how to do testing with the help of firebase.  \n\n\nWhat's next for TRAVIS-Traffic Realtime Assistant Via Internet Service\n\n\nIn future prospects, I want to integrate Internet of thing technology (IoT) with my app to provide real-time instant notification in case of a traffic accident. This notification will reach to the nearby police station, hospital and relatives of the person. \nI would also like to integrate machine learning algorithms to improve the quality of traffic feed and make it more relevant to the users based on their locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\nglide\nphotoshop\nvoll\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.dropbox.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.behance.net"

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "Genopets - The World's First Move-to-Earn NFT Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Genoverse map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSelecting a destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe step challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAugment system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\nThe idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to use a health data marketplace to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay active. While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass.

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development.

With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Because, the current level of technology sophistication provides us ample scope to overcome any problem that we have been grappling for many decades.\n\n\nWe, technocrats, who believe in the power of technology and have immense faith in a better tomorrow thought to address the second most popular cancer that has been quietly consuming lives across the world.\n\n\nPinc (Personal, Inclusive and Collaborative ), is a mobile app that empowers women and men in building awareness to prevent, diagnose and cure breast cancer, all the while maintaining individual privacy.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nPinc will weave-in a rich tapestry of human and systemic interventions that will change the way breast cancer is detected, diagnosed and cured. Be it breaking socio-economic and geo barriers or bringing in the right type of help at the right time, we have got them covered. \n\n\nOur Main objectives are:\n\n\n1)Have higher reach covering not just people with vision but those who are suffering with lack of vision and differently-abled people as well\n\n\n2)Enhance the diversity in coverage overcoming the barriers like geography, language, gender and technology to spread awareness\n\n\n3)Emphasis on prevention\n\n\n4)Enable easier communication through multiple channel to get answers to all questions utilizing Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n5)Help self diagnosis using artificial Intelligence with higher accuracy to stop and reduce the risk at early stages. It is cost effective and covers most people, even those who cannot afford\n\n\n6)Encouraging family and friends for quick and accurate Intelligent self diagnosis and spread awareness\n\n\n7)Motivate patients to volunteer and come forward by sharing their experience, social and health consequences\n\n\n8)Enable people to interact with doctors leveraging technology and help diagnose and treat with ease and accuracy\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\n1)Agile methodology and JIRA is considered as a project management tool\n2)Azure-DevOps for CI/CD, AWS Polly for Text to Speech Conversion \n3)Python and Jupyter is used for building Deep Learning neural networks and Machine Learning based models\n4)JUSTINMIND is enabled for building the prototype of the Mobile Application\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nWith the limited understanding on Medical Field we have to discuss our thought process with various health professionals and specialists to come up with entire process flow and data for building Artificial intelligence. \nConsidering the COVID Situation discussing with individuals and  understand their challenges was difficult. Our study was limited to consulting with medical professionals.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nIn a short duration, we were able to build an application which can cover all the aspects like awareness, prevention and fight against breast cancer. \nWe were able to work collaboratively with our team as well as discuss with various medical professionals to get a complete insight and hence were able to build a robust solution prototype. \n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe have identified all current challenges and gaps which are there in existing systems for breast cancer. We became ourselves aware of social and physical impact of breast cancer and campaigns or initiatives around the globe. Hence ,We were motivated to bridge all these gaps and think holistically to  come up with a robust solution Pinc. \n\n\nWhat's next for Pinc (Stands for Personal, Inclusive and Collaborative)\n\n\nWe would like to have a successful implementation across the globe with collaboration among various groups and individuals.\nWe would like to be a part of the cause in reduction of mortality rate by increasing the early detection of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nai\namazon-web-services\nazure\njira\njustinmind\npolly\npython\nscikit-learn\nvisualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

We did it at the beginning of the project with an airdrop of the SAIL max Supply. We will open-sourced all our developments and coming development. \n\n\n## What it does\n\nFirst part of the project is our TipSailBot for Discord. It's a simple and easy to use bot which allow any discord members of a server(with a specific role) to tip and receive tips. Because it will be open-sourced any team who built on Solana can update and use it for their discord/SPL token. The only 'SolanaSail' we included inside the code is a requirement of 1 SAIL and 1 gSAIL to be able to tip other discord members.\n\n\n## How we built it\n\nUsing Node.js,  web3.js\n\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe main challenge was to not store the user private keys on file or database, reason why at each bot restart the user need to re-import his private key or register a new tipsailbot wallet.\n\n\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\n\nTipSailBot users get their private keys from the bot when he register a new tipsailbot wallet, then this private key could be imported in a Phantom, Sollet, C98, MathWallet.... That way the user has control on his tipsailbot wallet. We do not store on file or database the private keys.\n\n\n## What we learned\n\nThe most sensible security part is the import-wallet, members has to import private keys by DM the tipsailbot and for that reason we have restricted and encouraged to restrict the usage of this command to discord specific roles(setup in the config file).\n\n\nWhat's next for SolanaSail\n\n\nCompletion of our tipsailbot integration in our discord battleship game(on going).

To achieve it's full potential, bitcoin needs to be accessible and easy to use. Millions of vending machines are used on a daily basis. Enabling vending machines across the world with an approachable way to accept bitcoin payments is our vision of an effective way to help achieve worldwide adoption.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nOur project is a vue.js application that connects an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine to the Bitcoin Lightning Network for receiving payments via the opennode API.\n\n\n\n\nThis app is a payment UI running on a secure tablet connected to an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine.\n\n\nThe app's simple to use and intuitive interface makes the Bitcoin Lightning Network more user friendly and approachable.\n\n\nThe app connects to the OpenNode Lightning API to create a payment invoice.\n\n\nWhen the invoice is paid, it notifies the CryptoVend of the payment.\n\n\nThe vending machine receives the credit notification and then will dispense product once the user makes their desired selection.\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Installation\n\n\nThe following are the steps to run your own Lightning Network enabled vending machine:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the iozeta CryptoVend device into an MDB capable vending machine.\n\n\nFollow instructions at \nhttps://github.com/iozeta/cryptovend-tablet-ui\n\n\nConnect a tablet to the same WiFi internet network as the vending machine.\n\n\nStart the app on your tablet.\n\n\nTap the \"Tap to Start\" button.\n\n\nScan the QR code to send a Bitcoin Lightning Network payment.\n\n\nMake item selection to dispense the desired product from the vending machine.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nDetermining how to connect to the Lightning Network on an Android tablet in a robust and reliable way was the most significant challenge we faced.

Since we are already maintaining a community, the need for our app to support wallets in multiple platforms is essential. We need to be very flexible on making changes and make the app highly maintainable to adapts the rapid developing of Solana ecosystems.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe have already launched the beta version of project just one week before the submission and there is already community of users successfully stake, claim, and made withdrawals via our Vue web app. There are problems on staking and viewing staking information on the first days of launching, and we managed to solve all the issue just in one day. \n\n\nCompared to existing on-chain timelock staking app, we featured a simpler UI/UX to stake, claim rewards and withdraws, all staking information such as user balance, total user staked, total user claimable and pending withdrawals are viewable in a glances.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nBeing the first project we ever launched, we have learnt to use solana ecosystem tools, command lines and library to deploy our first program and built.\n\n\n\n\nsolana web3\n\n\nserum\n\n\nsolana wallet adapter\n\n\nanchor\n\n\nsolana cli\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for OXS Timelock Staking App\n\n\nWe'll constantly monitor the app for any security and performance issues, integrate with more wallets, understand users' behaviour and provide more staking metrics and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nserum\nsolana\nvue\nweb3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking-oxs.oxbull.tech"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

On this pandemic situation we come across lot of people in a risk of losing their life though staying inside the home .The reason behind this is,not COVID-19 but POVERTY. There also exist people who is passionate to  serve the society by providing the people needs .So we,the TEAM CRUTCH has decided to serve the society through our tech minds by designing the app  called CRUTCH which act as bridge between the donor & recipient .\n\n\nThis application is built on top of  PEGA platform version 8.4\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nThe challenging task for us is making the live request ,choosing the most needful services,handling the services between donor & recipient .But as a team we were  able to conquer the challenges in to fruitful product.\n\n\nCRUTCH acts as a platform of sharing assets to needy people at right time from donors.\n\n\nLearning Experience\n\n\nWe had a great learning experience .We had a chance of experiencing activities,customizing harness & portal.\n.\n\n\nUniqueness of Our Application CRUTCH\n\n\nCrutch provides the customer 6 services ,where the customer can chose any service through his/her interest.\n\n\nBringing the Need at your doorstep & right time.\n\n\nApart from donor & requester crutch has an additional feature of volunteer for people who is passionate in serving the society to assist donor & recipient in bringing their need at their doorstep a right time. Serve the society-tops the leader board. Crutch has an unique feature of maintaining leader board for volunteers \non the basis of one who serves the best leads as top performer in leader board.\n\n\nAbout crutch\n\n\nCrutch  is a platform that extends help for the needy people at right time.The motive of crutch is to concatenate the demand & supply . The services available in this app includes Food Service,Education \nService ,Cloth Service ,Blood donate/Receive (share blood ) service ,Organ donate /receive (share organ) service,Money (Crutch pay )service .\n\n\nHow Crutch Works\n\n\nCustomer can register as donor/recipient initially .while logging in the next time he has the option to change his role type if he wills. After logging in he can chose any of six exclusive services .If the customer acts as recipient he can request his/her need. The intimation about the request will be sent to all registered donors if any of the donor accepts to donate, then crutch provides them an option to chose Volunteer assistance .if he chooses volunteer service the crutch volunteer will help in delivering the requirement from donor to recipient at right time. Thereby crutch feed the needy people at right time. Crutch  has verification team to ensure that details submitted by recipient doesn't contain any false information.\n\n\nCrutch Functionality\n\n\nThe crutch has 6 services apart from registration & Volunteer Survey & Feed the Need.The following is the detailed description of all case type.\n\n\n1)Registration:\n    The customer can sign in in to crutch application via registration case type. He has to specify his role type(donor/recipient) & service type(6 services) based on which the work group & workbaskets are assigned for them.They can change role type in future as well.After providing the preliminary details such as personal info,Organisation info(if he/she representing any org) & address details.After the approval by the admin crutch the access credentials are created for the customer.The case will not move to approval unless he accept terms & conditions of crutch .\nInnovation:\nWe have implemented completion status- Progress bar for the customer to track his registration completion status\n\n\n2)Feed The Need:\n   The purpose of this case type is to help the needy people in choosing the service according to their need.\nSix exclusive services are shown to customer on their next login where he/she can choose one and proceed with flow.\n\n\nInnovation: Six attractive icons are configured where the user clicks the Icon the corresponding case type begins.\n\n\n3)Crutch Pay:\n    The purpose of this case type is to donate/receive money .The recipient begins the case where he views all his details in editable format .They can edit it if necessary.The  customer can raise money request for his own self or for his friend/relatives.In case of friend/relative .He has to provide their details.There are few predefined reasons present for requesting money such as requesting fund for orphanage/home, requesting fund for natural calamity,,requesting for illness/Accident .Customer can also provide his own reason of requesting by choosing others.He has to provide all the required info along with necessary documents.He will also specify his preferred timing for help.After his submission,there happens background verification process by crutch admin where all details are checked. The case proceeds forward only if details are true. Then on the successful completion of verification the intimation will be sent to all donors if any donors accepts he can confirm his own details and move for payment. Method of Payment can also be Negotiated by donor if he is comfortable with.After receiving the money the recipient fills the fullfilment and provide feedback.\n\n\nInnovation:Modal dialog -Pop up for thanking the customer\n\n\n4)Food Service:\n  The donor /Recipient can begin the case by providing the Food details.If recipient begins the case it moves to donor for viewing the recipient details and if he accepts the request then it moves to gather delivery information.There the recipient has an option of requesting any volunteer service then the case routes to volunteer workbasket if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\nIf the donor begins the case he provides the details of donating food,the case routes to recipient workbasket .\nThe recipient has an option of selecting self or volunteer service .If he goes for volunteer service ,then it routes to volunteer workbasket.if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\n\n\n5)Cloth Service:\n               The donor /Recipient can begin the case by providing the Food details.If recipient begins the case it moves to donor for viewing the recipient details and if he accepts the request then it moves to gather delivery information.There the recipient has an option of requesting any volunteer service then the case routes to \nvolunteer workbasket if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.If the donor begins the case he provides the details of donating cloth.the case routes to recipient workbasket .The recipient has an option of selecting self or volunteer service .If he goes for volunteer service ,then it routes to volunteer workbasket.if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\n\n\n6)Education Service:\n   The recipient begins the case where he has the option to acts as referencer or self based on type of request he raise. If he is raising for him he can provide as self, if not he can act as referencer. He gives all his preliminary details & attach Necessary Documents.Then the case move forwards to background verification Process. \nUnless the background verification successfully completes the case does not move forward .On Successful completion ,it routes to donor workbasket.If any of the donor accept to provide contact details are shared with both.Then fulfillment details are received from recipient after receiving the help.\n\n\n7)Share Blood:\n   This case type can be accessed by donor/Recipient.If donor begins the case he can donate the blood by Providing  all the necessary details .If in case of recipient begins the case ,he has two options either he can view the already donated blood details which matches his requirements or he can raise a new request.After his submission of request the case move forwards to donor where he can accept the request & confirm his details and also assist for volunteer service..thus,with help of volunteer support requirements are delivered from donor to recipient.\n\n\n8)Share Organ:\n    This case type can be accessed by donor/Recipient.If donor begins the case he need to provide his details If he had his organ registration certificate he need to attach it then the admin will review. Then the admin will approve /reject his request. If he does not have his organ registration certificate he can request for medical assistance.Now the hospital details are mailed to the donor. He have to visit the hospital within 5 days.Then the will check him and provide the certificate. If the case is begins by the recipient he can request for the organ.Noe he need to provide the required information and the certificate.Then the case will be routed to Donor hospital. If  the donor is available the details will be send through mail.Then he will contact the hospital for further procedure.\nhis hackathon is one of the memorable learning experience for our team .We had a great learning experience of new rules such as creating dynamic routing etc.\n\n\nWhat's Next\n\n\nAs a team we ensure to give our cent percent  effort to bring solutions to the problems & Challenges prevail in the society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "MeanFi - the most amazing and simple DeFi experience on Solana \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nDEMO VIDEO\n\n\ud83d\udc49\nPRESENTATION\n\n\nThe promise of DeFi: \nTo bank and invest without a trusted central counterparty\n has not been fulfilled yet. Most protocols target pro investors and leave out regular banking users.  \n\n\nAs a group of ex-pats from Latin American countries that have gone through dictatorships, communism, massive inflation, and economic stagnation for decades, we feel crypto and defi are the only way forward for us and the rest of the world.  \n\n\nThis is a race for freedom. To win it fast we need to bring everybody else for this ride, not only the cyberpunks, and the developers, and the traders, and the investors... but also the moms, dads, kids, and workers moving billions of dollars in remittances, payroll, recurring savings for school and retirement accounts.  \n\n\nThis is why we are building MeanFi, it has a very powerful double bottom line of doing good while doing well for everyone involved. We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time. \n\n\n\n\nHow I built it\n\n\nI started building the app by first drawing the mockups or rough sketches on paper.

For version control system, I used github and whole source code of this app is present on my github repository.  \n\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\n\nBeing the only developer for such a large project, I had to manage my time efficiently. From designing to developing to testing. I did it all.

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey .

        "content": "Genopets - The World's First Move-to-Earn NFT Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Genoverse map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSelecting a destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe step challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAugment system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\nThe idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to use a health data marketplace to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay active. While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass.

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development. What problems we have been thinking about and the mission of our efforts is to help users participate in DeFi more quickly and conveniently.\n\n\nWhat's the next for Soapy Finance\n\n\nAccording to the roadmap, we will focus on product development.\n\n\n\n\n Product Development\n\n\n Users growths and community building\n\n\n Fundraising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nes\njava\nobjective-c\npython\nredis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoapy.finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napy.top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter.com"

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Be it breaking socio-economic and geo barriers or bringing in the right type of help at the right time, we have got them covered. \n\n\nOur Main objectives are:\n\n\n1)Have higher reach covering not just people with vision but those who are suffering with lack of vision and differently-abled people as well\n\n\n2)Enhance the diversity in coverage overcoming the barriers like geography, language, gender and technology to spread awareness\n\n\n3)Emphasis on prevention\n\n\n4)Enable easier communication through multiple channel to get answers to all questions utilizing Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n5)Help self diagnosis using artificial Intelligence with higher accuracy to stop and reduce the risk at early stages. It is cost effective and covers most people, even those who cannot afford\n\n\n6)Encouraging family and friends for quick and accurate Intelligent self diagnosis and spread awareness\n\n\n7)Motivate patients to volunteer and come forward by sharing their experience, social and health consequences\n\n\n8)Enable people to interact with doctors leveraging technology and help diagnose and treat with ease and accuracy\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\n1)Agile methodology and JIRA is considered as a project management tool\n2)Azure-DevOps for CI/CD, AWS Polly for Text to Speech Conversion \n3)Python and Jupyter is used for building Deep Learning neural networks and Machine Learning based models\n4)JUSTINMIND is enabled for building the prototype of the Mobile Application\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nWith the limited understanding on Medical Field we have to discuss our thought process with various health professionals and specialists to come up with entire process flow and data for building Artificial intelligence. \nConsidering the COVID Situation discussing with individuals and  understand their challenges was difficult. Our study was limited to consulting with medical professionals.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nIn a short duration, we were able to build an application which can cover all the aspects like awareness, prevention and fight against breast cancer. \nWe were able to work collaboratively with our team as well as discuss with various medical professionals to get a complete insight and hence were able to build a robust solution prototype. \n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe have identified all current challenges and gaps which are there in existing systems for breast cancer. We became ourselves aware of social and physical impact of breast cancer and campaigns or initiatives around the globe. Hence ,We were motivated to bridge all these gaps and think holistically to  come up with a robust solution Pinc. \n\n\nWhat's next for Pinc (Stands for Personal, Inclusive and Collaborative)\n\n\nWe would like to have a successful implementation across the globe with collaboration among various groups and individuals.\nWe would like to be a part of the cause in reduction of mortality rate by increasing the early detection of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nai\namazon-web-services\nazure\njira\njustinmind\npolly\npython\nscikit-learn\nvisualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

We did it at the beginning of the project with an airdrop of the SAIL max Supply. We will open-sourced all our developments and coming development. \n\n\n## What it does\n\nFirst part of the project is our TipSailBot for Discord. It's a simple and easy to use bot which allow any discord members of a server(with a specific role) to tip and receive tips. Because it will be open-sourced any team who built on Solana can update and use it for their discord/SPL token. The only 'SolanaSail' we included inside the code is a requirement of 1 SAIL and 1 gSAIL to be able to tip other discord members.\n\n\n## How we built it\n\nUsing Node.js,  web3.js\n\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe main challenge was to not store the user private keys on file or database, reason why at each bot restart the user need to re-import his private key or register a new tipsailbot wallet.\n\n\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\n\nTipSailBot users get their private keys from the bot when he register a new tipsailbot wallet, then this private key could be imported in a Phantom, Sollet, C98, MathWallet.... That way the user has control on his tipsailbot wallet. We do not store on file or database the private keys.\n\n\n## What we learned\n\nThe most sensible security part is the import-wallet, members has to import private keys by DM the tipsailbot and for that reason we have restricted and encouraged to restrict the usage of this command to discord specific roles(setup in the config file).\n\n\nWhat's next for SolanaSail\n\n\nCompletion of our tipsailbot integration in our discord battleship game(on going). Then after more playtoearn game could be developed(Poker, BlackJack....), the governance DAO will proposed and decide.\nA governance DAO platform using part of Mango DAO Governance code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndiscord.js\nnode.js\nweb3.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscord.gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

To achieve it's full potential, bitcoin needs to be accessible and easy to use. Millions of vending machines are used on a daily basis. Enabling vending machines across the world with an approachable way to accept bitcoin payments is our vision of an effective way to help achieve worldwide adoption.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nOur project is a vue.js application that connects an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine to the Bitcoin Lightning Network for receiving payments via the opennode API.\n\n\n\n\nThis app is a payment UI running on a secure tablet connected to an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine.\n\n\nThe app's simple to use and intuitive interface makes the Bitcoin Lightning Network more user friendly and approachable.\n\n\nThe app connects to the OpenNode Lightning API to create a payment invoice.\n\n\nWhen the invoice is paid, it notifies the CryptoVend of the payment.\n\n\nThe vending machine receives the credit notification and then will dispense product once the user makes their desired selection.\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Installation\n\n\nThe following are the steps to run your own Lightning Network enabled vending machine:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the iozeta CryptoVend device into an MDB capable vending machine.\n\n\nFollow instructions at \nhttps://github.com/iozeta/cryptovend-tablet-ui\n\n\nConnect a tablet to the same WiFi internet network as the vending machine.\n\n\nStart the app on your tablet.\n\n\nTap the \"Tap to Start\" button.\n\n\nScan the QR code to send a Bitcoin Lightning Network payment.\n\n\nMake item selection to dispense the desired product from the vending machine.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nDetermining how to connect to the Lightning Network on an Android tablet in a robust and reliable way was the most significant challenge we faced. We found that the opennode API was both robust and reliable -- opennode was also very intuitive, making it relatively easy to implement.

Since we are already maintaining a community, the need for our app to support wallets in multiple platforms is essential. We need to be very flexible on making changes and make the app highly maintainable to adapts the rapid developing of Solana ecosystems.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe have already launched the beta version of project just one week before the submission and there is already community of users successfully stake, claim, and made withdrawals via our Vue web app. There are problems on staking and viewing staking information on the first days of launching, and we managed to solve all the issue just in one day. \n\n\nCompared to existing on-chain timelock staking app, we featured a simpler UI/UX to stake, claim rewards and withdraws, all staking information such as user balance, total user staked, total user claimable and pending withdrawals are viewable in a glances.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nBeing the first project we ever launched, we have learnt to use solana ecosystem tools, command lines and library to deploy our first program and built.\n\n\n\n\nsolana web3\n\n\nserum\n\n\nsolana wallet adapter\n\n\nanchor\n\n\nsolana cli\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for OXS Timelock Staking App\n\n\nWe'll constantly monitor the app for any security and performance issues, integrate with more wallets, understand users' behaviour and provide more staking metrics and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nserum\nsolana\nvue\nweb3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking-oxs.oxbull.tech"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The services available in this app includes Food Service,Education \nService ,Cloth Service ,Blood donate/Receive (share blood ) service ,Organ donate /receive (share organ) service,Money (Crutch pay )service .\n\n\nHow Crutch Works\n\n\nCustomer can register as donor/recipient initially .while logging in the next time he has the option to change his role type if he wills. After logging in he can chose any of six exclusive services .If the customer acts as recipient he can request his/her need. The intimation about the request will be sent to all registered donors if any of the donor accepts to donate, then crutch provides them an option to chose Volunteer assistance .if he chooses volunteer service the crutch volunteer will help in delivering the requirement from donor to recipient at right time. Thereby crutch feed the needy people at right time. Crutch  has verification team to ensure that details submitted by recipient doesn't contain any false information.\n\n\nCrutch Functionality\n\n\nThe crutch has 6 services apart from registration & Volunteer Survey & Feed the Need.The following is the detailed description of all case type.\n\n\n1)Registration:\n    The customer can sign in in to crutch application via registration case type. He has to specify his role type(donor/recipient) & service type(6 services) based on which the work group & workbaskets are assigned for them.They can change role type in future as well.After providing the preliminary details such as personal info,Organisation info(if he/she representing any org) & address details.After the approval by the admin crutch the access credentials are created for the customer.The case will not move to approval unless he accept terms & conditions of crutch .\nInnovation:\nWe have implemented completion status- Progress bar for the customer to track his registration completion status\n\n\n2)Feed The Need:\n   The purpose of this case type is to help the needy people in choosing the service according to their need.\nSix exclusive services are shown to customer on their next login where he/she can choose one and proceed with flow.\n\n\nInnovation: Six attractive icons are configured where the user clicks the Icon the corresponding case type begins.\n\n\n3)Crutch Pay:\n    The purpose of this case type is to donate/receive money .The recipient begins the case where he views all his details in editable format .They can edit it if necessary.The  customer can raise money request for his own self or for his friend/relatives.In case of friend/relative .He has to provide their details.There are few predefined reasons present for requesting money such as requesting fund for orphanage/home, requesting fund for natural calamity,,requesting for illness/Accident .Customer can also provide his own reason of requesting by choosing others.He has to provide all the required info along with necessary documents.He will also specify his preferred timing for help.After his submission,there happens background verification process by crutch admin where all details are checked. The case proceeds forward only if details are true. Then on the successful completion of verification the intimation will be sent to all donors if any donors accepts he can confirm his own details and move for payment. Method of Payment can also be Negotiated by donor if he is comfortable with.After receiving the money the recipient fills the fullfilment and provide feedback.\n\n\nInnovation:Modal dialog -Pop up for thanking the customer\n\n\n4)Food Service:\n  The donor /Recipient can begin the case by providing the Food details.If recipient begins the case it moves to donor for viewing the recipient details and if he accepts the request then it moves to gather delivery information.There the recipient has an option of requesting any volunteer service then the case routes to volunteer workbasket if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\nIf the donor begins the case he provides the details of donating food,the case routes to recipient workbasket .\nThe recipient has an option of selecting self or volunteer service .If he goes for volunteer service ,then it routes to volunteer workbasket.if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\n\n\n5)Cloth Service:\n               The donor /Recipient can begin the case by providing the Food details.If recipient begins the case it moves to donor for viewing the recipient details and if he accepts the request then it moves to gather delivery information.There the recipient has an option of requesting any volunteer service then the case routes to \nvolunteer workbasket if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.If the donor begins the case he provides the details of donating cloth.the case routes to recipient workbasket .The recipient has an option of selecting self or volunteer service .If he goes for volunteer service ,then it routes to volunteer workbasket.if any of the volunteer picks the work, then he confirms the donor& recipient address details and finally he delivers to them.\n\n\n6)Education Service:\n   The recipient begins the case where he has the option to acts as referencer or self based on type of request he raise.

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Most protocols target pro investors and leave out regular banking users.  \n\n\nAs a group of ex-pats from Latin American countries that have gone through dictatorships, communism, massive inflation, and economic stagnation for decades, we feel crypto and defi are the only way forward for us and the rest of the world.  \n\n\nThis is a race for freedom. To win it fast we need to bring everybody else for this ride, not only the cyberpunks, and the developers, and the traders, and the investors... but also the moms, dads, kids, and workers moving billions of dollars in remittances, payroll, recurring savings for school and retirement accounts.  \n\n\nThis is why we are building MeanFi, it has a very powerful double bottom line of doing good while doing well for everyone involved. We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time. \n\n\n\n\nHow I built it\n\n\nI started building the app by first drawing the mockups or rough sketches on paper. After designing came the part of development. For backend I used firebase. For version control system, I used github and whole source code of this app is present on my github repository.  \n\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\n\nBeing the only developer for such a large project, I had to manage my time efficiently. From designing to developing to testing. I did it all.

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass. Work carried out even he was immobilized on hospital bed. \n\n\nFinished UI design v2, working on v3, working toward internal test end Oct and MVP end Nov.\n\n\nComplete seed round with 3 times over subscription, investors are all tier-1 investment firms, both crypto native and traditional funds. \n\n\nHave advisors from game, running app and blockchain industries to help us refine the product.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nA good game producer can save a lot of time and head scratching (lucky we have one with 15 years experience). \n\n\nDon\u2019t exercise right after eating.\n\n\nGive project a good name is very hard work (still working on it)\n\n\nDon\u2019t start pitching capitals until the team find what is the real pain point or sweat spot. \n\n\nA good Game-Fi project must be a good game first, a smooth-running application second, and has a tokenomic that makes sense third.  \n\n\nSometime focusing too much on the nitty gritty makes you lose perspective; we need constantly tell ourselves what is our vision and stop tunnel vision on things.\n\n\nWhat's next for Find Satoshi\n\n\nFinish private round and release MVP in Nov, use fund raised to get 1 million non-crypto players before the end of this year. \n\n\n24th Oct Update\n \n\n\nv2.o working demo is available for testing, feature include:\nGPS tracking fuction;\nLevel up sneaker;\nMystery Box looting;\nBetter user account interface;\nBetter sneaker detail page;\nSimplified version of wallet.\n\n\nv2.0 demo video: \nhttps://youtu.be/-0nS-ZtJmkU\n\n\nAddressing to judging criteria\n\n\nPotential Impact\n\nStepN has potential to bring tenth of million new users to solana ecosystem through funneling runners to crypto player.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\nThe project is in alpha testing and we will start public beta testing within a week.\n\n\nNovelty\nThere is no move2earn game on mobile devices other than ours.\n\n\nDesign\nWe have several well experienced game developer and UI/UX designer working on this proejct.\n\n\nGo-to-market Strategy\nWe will start from building crypto community before the full product releases to the market, after the full product release, we will focus on non-crypto runners and leverage main stream media on the topic of carbon reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\namazon-web-services\njava\njavascript\nlinux\nmysql\nnode.js\nrust\nsolidity\ntypescript"

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development. What problems we have been thinking about and the mission of our efforts is to help users participate in DeFi more quickly and conveniently.\n\n\nWhat's the next for Soapy Finance\n\n\nAccording to the roadmap, we will focus on product development.\n\n\n\n\n Product Development\n\n\n Users growths and community building\n\n\n Fundraising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nes\njava\nobjective-c\npython\nredis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoapy.finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napy.top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter.com"

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

The only 'SolanaSail' we included inside the code is a requirement of 1 SAIL and 1 gSAIL to be able to tip other discord members.\n\n\n## How we built it\n\nUsing Node.js,  web3.js\n\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe main challenge was to not store the user private keys on file or database, reason why at each bot restart the user need to re-import his private key or register a new tipsailbot wallet.\n\n\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\n\nTipSailBot users get their private keys from the bot when he register a new tipsailbot wallet, then this private key could be imported in a Phantom, Sollet, C98, MathWallet.... That way the user has control on his tipsailbot wallet. We do not store on file or database the private keys.\n\n\n## What we learned\n\nThe most sensible security part is the import-wallet, members has to import private keys by DM the tipsailbot and for that reason we have restricted and encouraged to restrict the usage of this command to discord specific roles(setup in the config file).\n\n\nWhat's next for SolanaSail\n\n\nCompletion of our tipsailbot integration in our discord battleship game(on going). Then after more playtoearn game could be developed(Poker, BlackJack....), the governance DAO will proposed and decide.\nA governance DAO platform using part of Mango DAO Governance code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndiscord.js\nnode.js\nweb3.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscord.gg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

To achieve it's full potential, bitcoin needs to be accessible and easy to use. Millions of vending machines are used on a daily basis. Enabling vending machines across the world with an approachable way to accept bitcoin payments is our vision of an effective way to help achieve worldwide adoption.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nOur project is a vue.js application that connects an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine to the Bitcoin Lightning Network for receiving payments via the opennode API.\n\n\n\n\nThis app is a payment UI running on a secure tablet connected to an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine.\n\n\nThe app's simple to use and intuitive interface makes the Bitcoin Lightning Network more user friendly and approachable.\n\n\nThe app connects to the OpenNode Lightning API to create a payment invoice.\n\n\nWhen the invoice is paid, it notifies the CryptoVend of the payment.\n\n\nThe vending machine receives the credit notification and then will dispense product once the user makes their desired selection.\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Installation\n\n\nThe following are the steps to run your own Lightning Network enabled vending machine:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the iozeta CryptoVend device into an MDB capable vending machine.\n\n\nFollow instructions at \nhttps://github.com/iozeta/cryptovend-tablet-ui\n\n\nConnect a tablet to the same WiFi internet network as the vending machine.\n\n\nStart the app on your tablet.\n\n\nTap the \"Tap to Start\" button.\n\n\nScan the QR code to send a Bitcoin Lightning Network payment.\n\n\nMake item selection to dispense the desired product from the vending machine.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nDetermining how to connect to the Lightning Network on an Android tablet in a robust and reliable way was the most significant challenge we faced. We found that the opennode API was both robust and reliable -- opennode was also very intuitive, making it relatively easy to implement.

Since we are already maintaining a community, the need for our app to support wallets in multiple platforms is essential. We need to be very flexible on making changes and make the app highly maintainable to adapts the rapid developing of Solana ecosystems.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe have already launched the beta version of project just one week before the submission and there is already community of users successfully stake, claim, and made withdrawals via our Vue web app. There are problems on staking and viewing staking information on the first days of launching, and we managed to solve all the issue just in one day. \n\n\nCompared to existing on-chain timelock staking app, we featured a simpler UI/UX to stake, claim rewards and withdraws, all staking information such as user balance, total user staked, total user claimable and pending withdrawals are viewable in a glances.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nBeing the first project we ever launched, we have learnt to use solana ecosystem tools, command lines and library to deploy our first program and built.\n\n\n\n\nsolana web3\n\n\nserum\n\n\nsolana wallet adapter\n\n\nanchor\n\n\nsolana cli\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for OXS Timelock Staking App\n\n\nWe'll constantly monitor the app for any security and performance issues, integrate with more wallets, understand users' behaviour and provide more staking metrics and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nserum\nsolana\nvue\nweb3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking-oxs.oxbull.tech"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue.

This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Most protocols target pro investors and leave out regular banking users.  \n\n\nAs a group of ex-pats from Latin American countries that have gone through dictatorships, communism, massive inflation, and economic stagnation for decades, we feel crypto and defi are the only way forward for us and the rest of the world.  \n\n\nThis is a race for freedom. To win it fast we need to bring everybody else for this ride, not only the cyberpunks, and the developers, and the traders, and the investors... but also the moms, dads, kids, and workers moving billions of dollars in remittances, payroll, recurring savings for school and retirement accounts.  \n\n\nThis is why we are building MeanFi, it has a very powerful double bottom line of doing good while doing well for everyone involved. We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time.

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

        "content": "Genopets - The World's First Move-to-Earn NFT Game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Genoverse map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSelecting a destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe step challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAugment system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\nThe idea for Genopets was born from our prior work in digital health exploring ways to use a health data marketplace to provide passive income to individuals as an incentive to stay active. While the infrastructure and industry for that concept was too early, we remained steadfast in the vision for passive income for health and pivoted to the Play-to-Earn gaming model earlier this year. We\u2019ve been blessed with narrative tailwinds and growth in this industry and are excited to keep innovating and growing with the community. With Genopets, not only do we hope to financially incentivize players to stay fit, we can encourage them to do so and have fun while doing it.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nGenopets is a Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT game on Solana that makes it fun and profitable to live an active lifestyle. Genopets combines user's step data from their mobile device and wearables with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so players can earn crypto for taking action in real life as they explore the Genoverse evolving and battling their Genopet.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built this on top of Metaplex\u2019s codebase - specifically the Token Metadata Program allows us to create mutable NFTs and update them at minimal cost. In the future, we intend to partner with Stardust to make this process even more seamless. The front-end is built using Unity and will be deployed to mobile. On the backend we have a simple REST API that performs simple operations such as minting NFTs and mutating them. For the minting process we currently use React / Next.js on the web and THREE.js for the graphics.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe main challenge we faced was getting the API of the metadata program correct when it was released before the Anchor framework and had no IDL to use. Then we realized that the metaplex repo had JS bindings for all the metaplex programs and that made things a lot easier. The second challenge was to get the augment body parts to be dynamic, which we ended up using a simple unity function to achieve for now but will move to an attachment system later.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne thing we are most proud of is that over the course of this hackathon, our community has grown significantly. Today we have more than 55k members on our Discord server and 28k followers on Twitter. This has helped validate the direction we\u2019re headed and motivated our team to keep pushing to build throughout the competition.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nKeeping logic and state completely separate may be hard to reason about at first, but becomes super elegant as you become familiar with it. For one, we basically don\u2019t need to touch rust as most of the logic we need to utilize are already deployed on-chain. This allows us to use Javascript bindings very heavily to achieve what we need to do.\n\n\nOn the game and economics design side, one of the main things we learned from our deep research into Play-to-Earn games is that the problem with the primary net inflow of cash into your economy coming from new players joining your game is that it too closely ties the stability of your economy to continued user growth. The point at which user growth stalls, the entire game economy could collapse. That is why we designed Genopets to be a crafting and evolution game where the net inflow of cash to the economy comes from players\u2019 active use and enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nWhat's next for Genopets\n\n\nFollowing the listing of Genopet Egg NFTs on FTX.us earlier this week, our Genesis Genopets NFT Mint drop is expected mid November, followed by a release of a private beta of the full game by the end of the year.

The idea started to get a clearer shape after we saw the success of Game-Fi, we gave it a little twist, we changed game mechanics from play2earn to move2earn, where game\u2019s profit is decided in a DAO manner \u2013 with a minimum 10% goes to carbon reduction. \n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nFind Satoshi Lab is the company behind the design of StepN, it is a mobile game pays players game token for each step they move; game token can be earned either passively or actively, and governance token can be earned after player hits max level. To play the game, player \nmust\n have a NFT sneaker, which can be bought or rent at no cost. Player can level up, add gemstones and produce new NFT sneakers in game through burning game tokens and/or governance tokens. \n\n\nPlayer can participate online Marathon to compete for top leader-board position and get rewards, or spend energy to do a power run to earn not only game/governance tokens, but also achievements and NFT badges. Certain NFT badges allow player to have certain perks in-game.\n\n\nThe essence of the game is to create a massive funnel to get non-crypto runners to the crypto community, starting from get them earn some tokens in their wallet by walking or running. Once they have some tokens in their wallet, they will think about cashing out, this will motivate them to learn how to use decentralized wallet and register to exchanges. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe idea of move2earn comes from a brainstorm session, where we initially wanted to do a Monopoly style game, during the discussion of how many steps a player should move on the play-board, one option was the player has to physically make the move, and we loved this idea. The entire game was then rebuilt around this move2earn concept. \n\n\nSeveral game development documents were drafted and refined, when we structured the game, we studied the popular Game-Fi on the market and concluded a successful mobile Game-Fi has to be able to transfer game asset conveniently, promptly and cheaply. So, we build the game around a built-in decentralized wallet that can transfer multiple chain\u2019s assets, a swap and cross-chain convert. After comparing and contrasting several top public chains, we picked Algorand and Solana to build on, Solana won because we found deploying on Algorand requires more works and its smart contract function is yet to be released. \n\n\nOur perception changed several times during we made this game, initially we think the financial part is important, because this is what draw people to play the game. Then we realized what really retain players is the game itself, there will always be a game that can makes more money in the future, if the financial part is the only thing retains the player, it will most likely fail when the next big thing come out. Hence instead of rushing the game, we then returned to the drawing board and refined on our game parts. We added a comprehensive achievement/challenge system, and we NFT it and develop further game plots to put a value/meaning to these NFT badges, this could be the biggest player retainer to us. \n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nNFT sneaker design (working on it). \n\n\nGame's balance among runner, gamer and crypto player (solving - game will not display features if it is not intended to certain player type, e.g. sneaker renter will not see gem socket, level up or sneaker production; we are also working on attribute modeling).\n\n\nIt is hard to involve \"gene\" in the production of sneaker section (solved through mystic sneaker socket)\n\n\nGame token always have a high sell pressure (solved through design a token sunk - gemstone, and a consistent token drain for consistent token earn - repair system)  \n\n\nAnti-cheating mechanism design (solving through machine learning).\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nOne co-founder ran 200kms in a month to test all running apps, then had his appendix and 1/3 colon removed due to appendicular mass.

        "content": "Inspiration\n\n\nWith the rapid growths of blockchain and DeFi, there are more and more DeFi projects establishing continually, but they are relatively isolated, which leading to three obvious problems.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, there are too many projects and they are so changeable. Therefore, it is difficult for users to find them quickly. \n\n\nWhat's more, different projects have different UI and interaction methods. Users can participate only after learning and understanding, which makes the experience uneven. \n\n\nLast but not least, most of the current projects and DeFi tools still focus on the PC, and the support for mobile is imperfect, which limits the time period and scenario when using.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are so many opportunities in the DeFi world, the market changes with each passing day. So far, there is no mobile APP based on the APY ranking that can help users to discover, search and analyze DeFi projects as fast as possible.\n\n\nFor example, I want to know which staking pool of USDT or ETH has the highest APY return across multi chains? Which staking pool's TVL & APY grows rapidly? How about the changing trend of TVL & APY? When will the launch of the new projects be? A great number of questions as mentioned above.\n\n\nHowever, such difficulties inspire us to create a mobile entrance for community users to participate in and find the opportunities for DeFi.\n\n\nWhat is Soapy?\n\n\nSoapy Finance is committed to building the future mobile entrance of DeFi. It brings friendly, efficient, and secure financial products and services to users. \n\n\nSoapy is governed by \nSoapy DAO\n, all community members who hold \nSOAPY\n can participate in project governance.\n\n\nAt present, it consists of two major parts: \n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP\n is a multi-chain DeFi projects aggregator. It is the first to support the APY & TVL ranking list, it sources most public blockchain's DeFi projects and pools data, appears with the mobile-first interactive mode, helps user to discover and analyze high-APY or new valuable DeFi projects easily.\n\n\nSoapy Swap\n is a multi-chain DEX aggregator. It provides a K-LINE visualization tool for the DEXes aggregated, helps users to know the trends of token prices. Soapy Swap aggregates major DEXes across various public blockchains and provides one-stop services to find the best prices and trading options for all types of crypto assets. In addition, Soapy Swap supports limit-price orderbook features for all users.\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe are a dynamic start-up team, and our core R & D personnel have been involved in the crypto field since 2017. We have a complete design and R & D process. APY.TOP is our first product, which supports H5 / Android / IOS access. At present, a beta version has been launched. Soapy Swap will be available in the near future.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThere are too many chances and tracks in blockchain development. We always focus on the infrastructure and data-analyze products of DeFi. In the further, the full cross-chain swap scenario will be also preliminarily planned. There are still some challenges in this area \n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n\n\n\nAPY.TOP DApp Beta version launched\n\n\nAPY.TOP Android Beta version available\n\n\nSolana, ETH, BSC ecosystem DeFi projects aggregated\n\n\nAPY & TVL K-LINE supported\n\n\nWallectConnect component integrated\n\n\n\n\nWe have built a core community across the world.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter: more than 2k unique followers\n\n\nTelegram: more than 1.5k unique members\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\n\n\nWe believe that the development of blockchain is still at an early stage, the popularity of DeFi is not enough, and there is plenty of room for development. What problems we have been thinking about and the mission of our efforts is to help users participate in DeFi more quickly and conveniently.\n\n\nWhat's the next for Soapy Finance\n\n\nAccording to the roadmap, we will focus on product development.\n\n\n\n\n Product Development\n\n\n Users growths and community building\n\n\n Fundraising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nes\njava\nobjective-c\npython\nredis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoapy.finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napy.top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter.com"

For many years, we have always wanted to build a horse racing game that solves the major problem of all the Horse Racing Video games out there: monetization. After years of exploration and research, we think now is the best time to build one, as the technology has grown more mature (Blockchain, NFT, and Solana) and because of public adoption (Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and NFT).\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nDarleyGo is the world's first mythical-based NFT horse racing game that's built on Solana, which allows players to purchase, race, collect and breed NFT horses. With the implementation of NFT, players can trade their in-game assets such as horses, and other in-game collections over any public NFT marketplace. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nFront end\n\n\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn start\n\n\n\nSolana Program\n\n\ncargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThis time, the most significant challenge was that we only had two weeks to build everything after joining the Hackathon. Since our project just started when we joined the Hackathon, we basically had to build everything from scratch.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nFrom all game graphics and style, frontend, to the backend, we've built everything in two weeks. We are really proud of what we've accomplished within the given time.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nTwo main things we've learned and deepened our knowledge during this Hackathon:\n\n\n1, Writing Solana Smart Contacts\n2, Creating NFT and saving data on the Solana network\n\n\nWhat's next for DarleyGo\n\n\nWe are just getting started. We have many ideas and plans (such as\u2026adding more in-game NFT assets such as jockey, equipment, and many more in-game items,  and integrating our game horses with the real world horses for racing with the AR/VR technology) for developing the game further, and are very confident that we are capable to build and implement our ideas and plans. However, to make the game a smash hit and a true Metaverse, we believe we need to connect with more parts within the Solana ecosystem to create synergy (Such as Dex, NFT Marketplace, games collaboration, and more...)  for reaching our ultimate goal! \n\n\nOur vision is to bring DarleyGo not only to crypto gamers but also to traditional gamers and horse racing fans, introducing more non-crypto people to the Blockchain world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\njavascript\nnextjs\nnode.js\npixijs\nreact\nrust\nsolana\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

To achieve it's full potential, bitcoin needs to be accessible and easy to use. Millions of vending machines are used on a daily basis. Enabling vending machines across the world with an approachable way to accept bitcoin payments is our vision of an effective way to help achieve worldwide adoption.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nOur project is a vue.js application that connects an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine to the Bitcoin Lightning Network for receiving payments via the opennode API.\n\n\n\n\nThis app is a payment UI running on a secure tablet connected to an iozeta CryptoVend enabled vending machine.\n\n\nThe app's simple to use and intuitive interface makes the Bitcoin Lightning Network more user friendly and approachable.\n\n\nThe app connects to the OpenNode Lightning API to create a payment invoice.\n\n\nWhen the invoice is paid, it notifies the CryptoVend of the payment.\n\n\nThe vending machine receives the credit notification and then will dispense product once the user makes their desired selection.\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Installation\n\n\nThe following are the steps to run your own Lightning Network enabled vending machine:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the iozeta CryptoVend device into an MDB capable vending machine.\n\n\nFollow instructions at \nhttps://github.com/iozeta/cryptovend-tablet-ui\n\n\nConnect a tablet to the same WiFi internet network as the vending machine.\n\n\nStart the app on your tablet.\n\n\nTap the \"Tap to Start\" button.\n\n\nScan the QR code to send a Bitcoin Lightning Network payment.\n\n\nMake item selection to dispense the desired product from the vending machine.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\nDetermining how to connect to the Lightning Network on an Android tablet in a robust and reliable way was the most significant challenge we faced. We found that the opennode API was both robust and reliable -- opennode was also very intuitive, making it relatively easy to implement.

Withdrawals can be made after a predefined period of time.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nThe program is using Solana Web3 and Vue.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nRapid development of Solana ecosystems forces our development to be built on a very fast pace. Since we are already maintaining a community, the need for our app to support wallets in multiple platforms is essential. We need to be very flexible on making changes and make the app highly maintainable to adapts the rapid developing of Solana ecosystems.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe have already launched the beta version of project just one week before the submission and there is already community of users successfully stake, claim, and made withdrawals via our Vue web app. There are problems on staking and viewing staking information on the first days of launching, and we managed to solve all the issue just in one day. \n\n\nCompared to existing on-chain timelock staking app, we featured a simpler UI/UX to stake, claim rewards and withdraws, all staking information such as user balance, total user staked, total user claimable and pending withdrawals are viewable in a glances.\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nBeing the first project we ever launched, we have learnt to use solana ecosystem tools, command lines and library to deploy our first program and built.\n\n\n\n\nsolana web3\n\n\nserum\n\n\nsolana wallet adapter\n\n\nanchor\n\n\nsolana cli\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for OXS Timelock Staking App\n\n\nWe'll constantly monitor the app for any security and performance issues, integrate with more wallets, understand users' behaviour and provide more staking metrics and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nserum\nsolana\nvue\nweb3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking-oxs.oxbull.tech"

We built the application on top of Pega CS 8.4 framework for Financial Services and augmented omnichannel experience by implementing\n\n\n\n\nVoice Bot with Google Assistance\n - We created Google Home dialogue flow project to define the intent, text analytics & extraction logic. The dialogue flow once invoked via Google Assistance voice bot, interacts with Pega API services exposed to return desired outcome through question & answer. \n\n\nMicrosoft Teams to enable video conferencing channel\n: We enabled the video channel through MS teams and integrated the solution with Web Chatbot & PegaChat, seamlessly respond to the complete digital needs of consumers. We have leveraged U+ Bank demo application for retail bank and enabled Web ChatBot through mashup. The ChatBot transfers interaction to a financial advisor of the bank through PegaChat using OOTB configuration. Video channel in launched as a service request from Customer 360 unlike Co-Browse and leverage Microsoft Teams Graph API 1.0 to create online meeting object and fetch the meeting URL for both customer & financial advisor to seamlessly have face to face meeting.\n\n\nQR code based Physical Access\n: We have created a new case type for enabling customer scheduling appointment through Self-Service portal of U+ bank through Web Mashup to limit the physical access to safe deposit boxes or for any other reason. It collects data from Customer on available time-slots on a given day and generates QR code which can be used for an entry to the bank\n\n\n\n\nChallenges we ran into -\n\n\nThe solution embraces technology plug-ins for Google Assistance & Microsoft teams and there were challenges in identifying the right API for the need. However one typical technical challenge we faced while transferring the interaction from Web ChatBot to PegaChat. Although we used OOTB configuration to enable web chatbot to support Live chat, the seamless hand-off between chatbot and PegaChat did not work because it was not getting the desired URL for PegaChat. We realized after quite a lot of tracing that the OOTB code was expecting the customer URL but there was no place to provide the URL or configuration in the web chat configuration from the self-service portal. We had to explicitly fetch the URL from the PegaChat configuration and set it in the data transform.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\n We have successfully added the most important channel (video with MS Teams) with Pega Customer Service in post Covid-19 context where any back office employee like Financial Advisor for Bank, Insurance Agent for Insurance company etc can able to conduct face-to face chat/meeting along with the customer 360 degree view to personalise the interaction \n\n\n This additional channel (can also be extended for other Video calling software) can be leveraged for any domain solution to engage customer 1:1 with a true digital omnichannel experience\n\n\n Cloud based platform and API based integration architecture helps in quick configuration with minimum effort and fast adoption in consumer community\n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned -\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major learning was how to leverage Google Dialogue flow to configure intents, text extraction and how to invoke REST API to call services in Pega. We studied both options of Action SDK & Dialogue flow and learned that Dialogue flow was better option as being hosted in cloud and also easier to configure. Also we learned lot around text extraction how google treats extracted data as text vs numbers etc.\n\n\nAnother learning was on the access token policy for MS Teams where we had to go through different grant type options and find the best one suitable for the integration. For example, using grant_type as \"access_code\" would require security challenge to the user, \"client_credentials\" would have restricted access to few API calls like onlineMeeting etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Customer Experience \u2013\n\n\nShifting towards new normal \u2013 \u201cDigitize the physical and humanize the digital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ndialogue-flow-google\nmicrosoft-graph\npega\nuplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaantic01.pegalabs.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaanticuplus.web.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsole.actions.google.com"

The games were canceled, the stadiums were closed, and fans left without an energetic community to celebrate their favorite team\u2019s victories. As professional sports leagues begin to return, these very same fans are craving a safe environment to cheer on a last-second basket or a walk-off home run surrounded by people who share their passion for sports. \n\n\nOur team has developed a solution and an app to fit this need. Sports In will function similar to a drive-in theater where fans can watch and celebrate sporting triumphs with others around them all while being safe and socially distanced in their vehicle. The Sports In the mobile app we developed will go hand in hand with various drive-in venues where tickets, food, and merchandise can all be purchased from the very same place. We created a business model that will create revenue for our team, the sports team, and the local community businesses.\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\nChase Catalano\n (Sales, Senior Business Management @ IU Bloomington)\nChase was responsible for creating an empathy map, organizing the potential challenges of our solution, and assisting with the business canvas model with regards to marketing. As a sales specialist, he is also the primary presenter in the project presentation. \n\n\nRay Lu\n (Project Manager, Junior Marketing and Business Analytics @ IU Bloomington)\nRay was the team\u2019s project manager responsible for scheduling meetings and keeping the team on track throughout the project duration. He worked on finding customer preferences and completed the SWOT analysis while also preparing the presentation slide deck. He also assisted in the Value Proposition Model and the Business Canvas Model.\n\n\nCarl Meyer\n (Graphic Designer, Sophomore Computer Graphics Technology @ Purdue)\nCarl created the app home page, built code for the QR ticketing feature, and worked on designing the user interface for the mobile app. Additionally, he helped build the game mode feature of the mobile app. He also designed the brand logo and enhanced the branding of our app from a design perspective. \n\n\nJainam Patel\n (Software Developer, Junior Computer and Information Technology @ Purdue)\nJainam was the lead programmer and was responsible for many of the key app features including authentication, security, navigation, and the payment process. Additionally, he built the administrator side of the app and was responsible for creating the demo of the app. \n\n\nJared Reid\n (Business Analyst, Junior Finance and Business Analytics @ Purdue)\nJared created the business canvas model including the revenue model to display how Sports In would create revenue and partner with local businesses. He worked with the coaches to address key analytics regarding our product. He also assisted on the empathy map, environmental analysis, and customer persona. \n\n\nAnnah Van Gheem\n (Data Scientist, Senior Statistics @ Butler)\nAnnah was responsible for collecting early data on sports fans in addition to addressing the possible questions customers may have. She created a storyboard for the primary workflow of the app and is also responsible for composing this document. \n\n\nHow did you decide on this customer segment, problem, and solution?\n\n\nThe SME shared that sports fans most missed the interaction with other fans and the multi-sensory experience of a sporting event. Another issue that we learned about from the SME was empty sporting venues empty around the country. Our solution aims to solve these problems. \n\n\nSports In was built to occur at the parking lot of a major sporting venue which ensures that the venue will be utilized in some capacity. Our solution also addresses the multi-sensory experience as fans will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a typical stadium with the option to also buy food that would be included in their ideal fan experience. \n\n\nThis product design caters to the customer who is sports-minded and enjoys social interaction but understands the severity of a global pandemic. This solution offers a much safer way to enjoy an event with like-minded people while avoiding a bar or other public space.  Further, at a typical drive-in tickets are purchased at the gate which can cause customers to be turned away. Our app includes a ticketing feature where the customer can purchase tickets to make the total experience as smooth as possible. The ticket will also be saved right in the app with a QR code. Customers can also buy merchandise from the app and can have flexible options to choose if they want to pick up merchandise on game day or have it delivered to their home. On game day, once the customer has checked in, their app will also turn into game mode where customers will be able to order food with the help of the app. Food will then be delivered at their parking spot will all safety precautions. The app also has an admin side where event managers, merchandise vendors, and food vendors can access. Once logged in, they can create an event with all of the event-specific information. Similarly, a food or merchandise vendor can enter their options. Merchandise and food vendors can see what orders they have received and can send merchandise or serve food by looking through the function of the order.\n\n\nHow did your team build and iterate on the solution?\n\n\nOur team began with a low fidelity prototype which took the form as a storyboard sketch to identify the workflow of the app. The next prototype was built with JavaScript and Android Studios as that is what the team had the most experience working with. Based on this first iteration as well as user testing with our coaches, we added key features such as a search bar as well as the ability to favorite an event within the app. In a further iteration, we expanded our mapping features to display what the venue would look like upon arriving.\n\n\nAlong the way, our coaches suggested simplifications such as easier navigation to make the app easier for the customer to use. As we implemented user testing, we also included a \nsearch bar and a feature that allows the user to favorite specific events. Additionally, we incorporated information from the business development side in order to ensure that the app being built was what the customer was looking for in a ticketing app experience. \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\n\nBelow are key metrics from our revenue model:\n\n\n\n\n250 parking spots available filled to 80% at $20 per parking spot would create $4,000 in ticket sales\n\n\nSportsIn would charge an $800 commission and additionally profit from $100 commission fees on food and merchandise vendors\n\n\nThe event host would make $1,000 per event as a conservative estimate when it is taken into account that there 82 games in a full season and 30 NBA teams, profit \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nSee Storyboard Images\n\n\nBelow are GitHub Links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInGameMode.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsInAdmin.git\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jainampatel7/SportsIn.git\n\n\n\n\nKey Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks\n\n\nBelow are the key tools we used in designing our app:\n\n\n\n\nGoogleMapsApi: We chose to use this tool to display the map of the event venue. It was clear and easy to use. \n\n\nFirebase: This is a secure database that we were comfortable and familiar with. \n\n\nPayPal Api: We chose to include PayPal API as a safe and secure payment option. It is reliable and familiar to many customers. \n\n\nAndroid Studios: We chose to build with AndroidStudios as it helped with our idea of simple navigation that we kept in mind throughout the building process.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools Include:\n\n\n\n\nRetrofit\n\n\nRoom\n\n\nRecyclerView\n\n\nPicasso\n\n\nGoogle play libraries \n\n\n\n\nIf you had another 5 weeks to work on this, what would you do next?\n\n\n\n\nWe would continue to build the administrator side of the mobile app. Due to the time constraints, we focused primarily on the user side of the app but would like the same app to have features for the administrator to track ticket sales and upload food and merchandise options. This piece would also have an accessible database for the administrators to use. \n\n\nWe would have liked to conduct more user testing with our target customers. Further, our research showed that 30% of sports fans would be interested in attending a sporting event during the pandemic. Given the safety measures implemented, we would like to conduct further research to see if the number increases. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to increase our marketing and advertising presence. We believe in our product and would like to share it with both the Indianapolis community and communities across the country. We have discussed marketing campaigns through Universities or Indianapolis tourism sites. We would like to do more research to see where our marketing campaigns would be most effective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nandroid\nandroid-studio\nfirebase\ngoogle-maps\njava\npaypal\nrecyclerview\nretrofit\nroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

We are bridging a huge gap by bringing DeFi and crypto to everyday banking workflows using simple terminology, awesome UX, and a mix of \nreally\n smart contracts to uncomplicate DeFi \ud83e\udd11\n\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nMeanFi makes everyday banking in the blockchain simple by allowing users to:  \n\n\n\n\nExchange your crypto at the best rates across Solana (w/ out \nHybrid Liquidity Aggregator\n).\n\n\nGrow your money stash with a Self-Custodial, Decentralized Dollar Cost Averaging (\nDDCA\n). \n\n\nSend recurring remittances or pay employees with money streams (\nmoney streaming protocol\n)\n\n\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nRust, Solana, Sealevel, Web3, React, Anchor\nTeam of 5. Please refer to the docs at: \nhttps://docs.meanfi.com\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nThe 5 biggest challenges we ran into:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up RPCs on a round-robin, with fallbacks, in a secure way has been a hassle. Most RPC providers offer very insecure ways to connect to them, forcing us to have to implement proxies, which are not ideal for the fastest experience.\n\n\nMany of the lego pieces we use, such as Serum CLOB and Raydium Liquidity Pools, do not have proper deployments of their contracts and SPL tokens in devnet, making it quite expensive to test in mainnet, since we have to spend real SOL and SPL tokens doing so. This also prevents us from doing automated unit tests of many of the code blocks that depend on these pieces.\n\n\nWhen we started building the hybrid liquidity aggregator, we hit a wall that was difficult to overcome. Turns out that splitting orders between AMMs and Serum's CLOB is not cheap, nor exact, since orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled down to the penny, as the sizes may not be fully matched on Serum for shallow markets, and often we'd end up getting breadcrumb refunds back into the wallets. This was one of the more consuming parts of building the aggregator, and we lost some neurons over it. Problem solved now, but it got to a point we were kinda discouraged by the process of discovering many surprises. \n\n\nWe wanted to get audited, but after reaching over 10 different auditing firms, we have not had much luck since they are all booked until 2022, and charge somewhere between $80k and $120k. A little chicken and egg situation here with the auditing. The plan is to issue a gov token for the Mean DAO and raise capital this way to cover startup costs.\n\n\nWe are a team of 5, all very technical and product-oriented. We have had the hardest time finding good marketing and biz dev people. When we went live on Mainnet on Sept 17th, we had a massive influx of people and users, and community to manage, and we were definitely not ready for that. We have somewhat figure things out, and have a healthy community as of Oct 15th of 13k users between discord and Twitter, and a little over 6k actual users on the app. \n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n\n\nWe've added over $1.9+ billion in liquidity across four AMM Protocols, and adding more every week.\n\n\nThe Money Streaming Protocol is siiiick, and covers a bunch of really neat use cases, like streaming money for salaries. The visuals in the UI look great, and we put a lot of brainpower and time when designing the protocol. See the \nWhite Paper\n\n\nMost people jump into crypto by using a CEX (like Coinbase or Kraken) to do Dollar Cost Average, because of the challenges and lack of options of doing so while keeping custody of your funds. We fixed that, and now you can... keep your keys and eat your DCA too \ud83d\ude05. We think this is a big step forward in bringing people around to crypto and Solana.\n\n\nWe went from < 20 user accounts in devnet to 6399 accounts in mainnet (and counting) in less than 30 days. \n\n\nWe have a really enthusiastic community supporting the project both on Twitter and Discord, with crazy levels of engagement. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nWe love DeFi, and we remain confident in Solana as the best blockchain to deliver on a decentralized and USABLE BY ALL financial ecosystem, and that conviction grows larger every day we work on MeanFi. There are lots of opportunities for improvement, especially around UX with wallets and Dapps, and that's what we are here to help change.\n\n\nWhat's next for Mean DAO\n\n\nWe plan on wrapping up our Stage 1 (Jobs) in 2021 which was all around the launch and focusing on consumer banking. Stage 2 is Hayek, with a focus on Investors, and there's a lot planned there.\n\n\n\nWe have a full roadmap laid out for the next 2-3 years.

With help of Crypto Payments any user can \nmake transactions much faster across globe enabling trust-less environment but most of the Software-As-A-Service (Saas) companies uses the concept of continuous and autonomous Payments popularly known as Recurring Payments in their business model\n however this isn\u2019t currently available in crypto space hence was born SuperPay - SuperPay is an end-to-end platform for real-time digital finance making Online Payments with \nCrypto currencies mainstream enabling trustless recurring crypto payments\n. Right now creating payment streams for cryptocurrencies is not possible but SuperPay makes it possible.\n\n\nIn very simplistic language SuperPay makes life of a vendor and consumer super simple by \nenabling recurring cryptocurrency payments from consumers to vendors from a single platform\n. These continuous, autonomous and trustless payments are powered Solana which makes them \nSuper Fast, Super Secure and Super Cheap\n (in terms of Transaction fees)\n\n\nSome of the Use Cases of SuperPay\ud83d\udd2d:\n\n\n\n\nSuperPay can be used for/by Over the top platforms\n like Netflix, spotify, and other subscription based services where the company's business model relies on recurring payments.\n\n\nEmployees Payrolls are recurring payments that are generally paid each month so, \nSuperPay can be used by companies to pay their employees in crypto\n. Employees can withdraw the amount by seconds. The crypto solution can ensure trustless payments.\n\n\n\n\nTrustless real-time finance makes it very easier for people to any good jobs on the Internet.\n \u2728\n\n\nBenefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumers\ud83e\uddd0:\n\n\nVendors Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nRecurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .\n\n\nAcceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsumers Benefits:\n\n\n\n\nWhile Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.\n\n\nCompanies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\ud83d\udd25:\n\n\nThe \nconcept of data storage on Solana\n was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for \naccounts and their ownership\n helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to these guys for guiding new solana devs like me and making our life less challenging:\n\n\n\n\n Armani Ferrante\n\n\nNader Dabit\n\n\nPaulx\n\n\nBrian Friel\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SuperPay? \ud83d\ude80:\n\n\nTake it to the Moon!!\n\n\nIn a short while I am planning to release SuperPay in Beta version, Also I will now focus on more of customer centric part of development and will add new features. I already see areas ready for improvement. The future is decentralised hence creating real life problems solving decentralised applications will automatically go to moon without any support the only condition is it should be scalable an in case of Solana and Serum it already satisfies the condition!\ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\nanchor\nnode.js\nreact\nrust\nserum\nsolana\ntailwind-css\ntypescript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"

Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  \n\n\nPedestrian Mode\n (Userbase: Pedestrians)\nActivate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   \n\n\nParking Finder\n (Drivers)\nParking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking. \n\n\nGeo Taxi Meter\n (Passengers)\nGeo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time. \n\n\n\n\nHow I built it\n\n\nI started building the app by first drawing the mockups or rough sketches on paper.

Yet, many engineers learn how to create UML class diagrams in school and then never use them again. Even at Lucid, where we build tools for visual communication, we haven\u2019t created class diagrams to document our software. Why?\n\n\nBecause the process of creating class diagrams can create more problems than it solves. It takes hours of tedious work to build the diagram initially, and the diagram is only useful as long as you keep it up to date. If you have a team of engineers adding and changing code daily, class diagrams just haven\u2019t been practical.\n\n\nAs part of a company-wide Hackathon, several Lucid employees dreamed up a solution to this problem: a way to remove the tedium and generate class diagrams directly from source code. We received positive feedback on the proof of concept around the office, and after speaking to Atlassians who were really excited about the idea, we decided to build out the concept in Bitbucket.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nThis Bitbucket add-on allows you to automatically generate UML class diagrams from your code repository. Once generated, these diagrams are available to everyone with read access to the repository, and you can:\n\n\n\n\nClick class members within your diagram and jump directly to their definitions in the source code.\n\n\nUpdate your diagram in one click when you push new code.\n\n\nOpen a copy of the diagram in Lucidchart if you want to make changes or share it outside of Bitbucket (Lucidchart also offers Confluence, JIRA, and HipChat integrations!).\n\n\n\n\nWhether you work alone or on a team, you can see your entire project architecture, including class dependencies and relationships, at a glance. The add-on currently works best with Java, with limited support for C++, C#, ObjectiveC, Go, and Python, and Ruby. More languages to come!\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe use ctags to extract symbol information from source code. From there, we create a dependency graph and turn it into a Lucidchart diagram. Finally, we use the hierarchy layout in Lucidchart to space out the elements perfectly, even for large diagrams.\nThis add-on was developed using \nAtlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud\n. We were also able to try out the new API Proxy feature and save hours of development time.\n\n\nWhat's next for Class Diagrams for Bitbucket\n\n\nWe would love to hear and incorporate your feedback as we continue developing this integration! So far, we\u2019d like to incorporate these features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic diagram update when new code is pushed\n\n\nImproved performance when generating large diagrams\n\n\nSupport for multiple programming languages\n\n\nAbility to embed diagram into the repo\u2019s README in one click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\natlassian-connect\nbitbucket\nbitbucket-api-proxy\njavascript\nscala\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.lucidchart.com"

As new employees to the organization, we initially faced some problems in reaching out to people who can help us. This inspired us to develop an application that helps the employees especially the new ones to get the problems sorted out. This mainly helps to avoid further misconceptions and help the employees for better interaction with the organization.\n    That made us realize how much of a business problem of not having a structured way for employees to reach out for help. Employee connect has been proven to be such an effective way to increase employee engagement.\n     Not just the fact that by raising the employee engagement we are going to increase your employee satisfaction but also gain awareness and most importantly build a stronger community where your business may be operating. Strong businesses are built in strong communities.\n\n\nLEARNING EXPERIENCE\n:\nWe had a great learning experience while creating this project. We also learned activities, creating a portal, harness, and customization. Importantly we learned Teamwork and coordination. \n\n\nABOUT\n:\n   Employee Connekt is a platform that helps the employee to get help at the right time. The main motive of the Employee Connekt is to leverage employee engagement with the organization. The services that are available with this project are resolving the queries, posting any suggestions, complaints, and requests for some facilities.\n\n\nThe uniqueness of our Employee Connekt:\n\n    Employee Connekt provides the feature which enables the employees to chat among themselves.\n\n\nHOW EMPLOYEE CONNEKT WORKS\n:\nThe employees can register themselves initially. After registering themselves they can log in with their username and password given at the time of registration. Once they log in, an Exchange view case will be enabled for them in which they can either Create or View the post. The employee will choose one of the options and provide the appropriate description and resolve the case. For Employee feed case, they can view the post based on the category posted by their colleagues.\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n:\n\n\n1)    REGISTRATION\n:\nFirst, the Employee needs to register by providing the details like First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Employee Id, email-id, username, and password. After successful registration, they are able to login with their username and password provided during registration. After login, they will be directed to our application.\n\n\n2)    EXCHANGE VIEWS\n:\nIn the Exchange views case type, we have four stages which are as follows:\n\n\nNew\n: In this stage, we have two options called create and view a post. Based on the option that the employee selects the decision is made on to which stage the case has to move on. If we select the create option then we have a choice to select one of the categories. \n\n\nImplementation\n: Based on the category that we have selected in the new stage then we will be moved to one of those categories like Suggestion details, Complaint details, request details, and queries details. In the category that we have selected, we have to specify the subtype along with the description.\n\n\nReview\n: In this stage, we have a step called review request where the manager will review all the requests raised by the employees.\n\n\nEnd\n: In this stage, we have the create case step which will be enabled when employees select the View post option in the first stage.\n\n\n3)    EMPLOYEE FEED\n:\nIn the Employee feed case type, we have two stages which are as follows:\nNew: In this stage, we have an option to select one of the categories we would like to view.\n\n\nPost View\n: In this stage, we can view the post based on the categories that the employee has selected in the first stage. There are also other options for the employees where they can upvote, downvote, comment, and chat with colleagues for the post.\n\n\nCHALLENGES\n:\nThe challenging task for us is to enable the chat feature for the employees.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n:\nAs a team, we ensure to give the cent percent effort for the employee satisfaction and resolve all the challenges the employee runs into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\npega\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com"

        "content": "[CASE STUDY] : Urban Reality - The Elevation of Perfection\n\n\nProject Overview:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a residential real estate company dedicated to creating one-of-a-kind homes that perfectly suit their client's lifestyle & this project is the \nCMS and CRM\n of Urban Reality's web app.\n\n\nIn the era of the internet it is mandatory for each and every one to have their presence or footprint on the internet to keep  pace with the advanced technology and cope up with the market hence I have created this complete solution for residential real estate and our company Urban Reality. The Project solves each and every problem that I have mentioned in the problem section very elegantly in no time.\n\n\nChallenge:\n\n\nUrban Reality is a local, family owned residential real estate company and is pretty old, about 16 years so as to speak started in 2005 by my father is doing great in our local city (Bhopal) residential real estate market, my father is colonizing the city in a very good way and Urban Reality had a good turnover, it was very easy at that time to get prospects on phone call without any other resources but in past couple of years due to high availability of internet and cheap smartphones, people nowadays in India search and look for everything on internet but Urban reality did not have any footprint on the internet, not even a landing page. We were lagging behind in terms of new prospects, sale leads , etc. Urban Reality settled a goal of increasing sales, but as is the case for most high-end home builders, not just any lead is the right fit. Urban Reality wanted to increase their number of qualified leads so they could build at a higher price-point that suited their place in the market. They needed to increase their overall traffic to draw in qualified leads that fit their business model. To do that, they not only needed an effective digital marketing strategy, they also needed a platform where they could bring those leads in and have a nurturing footprint on the internet.\n\n\nTo solve all these problems comes HUBSPOT (CMS and CRM) a much more advanced way to solve these above problems.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\nSeeing the problems of not getting the prospects and customer via classical way of calling people I decided to devise a solutions to all the problems mentioned above  and it comes packed in a platform called \nHUBSPOT (CMS and CRM)\n and after learn how easily this platform can solve our problem I jump into bits and pieces of Hubspot and get my first footprint for Urban Reality - it is an web app which is very beautifully designed not just to attract the customer but also to nurture them by providing useful content information on the website and a great user experience and in the same time getting useful information from customers through \nHubspot FORM FEATURE\n and taking the sales and task feature forward, this is how I solved the whole problem for Urban Reality.\n\n\nThe CRM feature of Hubspot not just helped us to generate more leads but also help us to close the customer overall Hubspot is the only platform that can solve these problem completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncms\ncrm\nform\nhubdb\nhubspot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurbanreality-20019653.hs-sites.com"

This is the main reason which inspired us to initiate this idea . \n\n\nA lot of young and inspiring entrepreneurs are seeking for a right platform to showcase their skill  and to grab an opportunity to increase their productivity. we decided to come with an idea by providing the platform to encourage their career.\n\n\nA \nsurvey\n of 848 smaller organizations conducted survey revealed that 33 percent of their had jobs left unfilled because they couldn't find people with relevant skills. This leads to apply our idea in this case.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Statistics\n\n\nA damaging impact on an economy as large as India ,  caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies.\n\nAnalyzing the research and statistics , We realized that our idea will help us to solve this problem . That's Why we came up  with VserveU  - An Application Make Business Easier.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nVserveU is a platform that acts as a bridge between the service provide and service requestor to showcase their individual skill and also to increase the productivity.  A service provider is an individual or  an entity that provides services to third party. The provision of services from a  service provider is governed by a service agreement of VserveU application. A service requester  is an individual or an entity that request services from third party.\n\n\nPublish the provider detail:\n\n\nGood data allows organizations to establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to keep moving forward. So Good Data will increase the interaction of customer . In VserveU, provider deliver the necessary data . Provider can either be freelancer or representor of an organization . They provide  personal detail followed by organization detail which includes why should the customer choose their organization and the uniqueness of their organization . Add on to that ,They submit their previous work  along with ID proof followed by the address of  organization .\n\n\nData reliability:\n\n\nReliable Data is the key to customer success. VserveU ensures the data reliability  by implementing the managerial approval. This approval process ensures that the provider submits accurate data else will prevent  him from commencing the case.\n\n\nExplore the provider :\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to the  growth of any business. VserveU keeps the promise of  customer satisfaction by providing the requestor with nine variety of business types in which each business type incorporates with N number of services.  The greater the number of options the app provide,  the greater the likelihood of finding what's  perfect for the customer , which eventually pave a way to  customer satisfaction. \n\n\nPackage preference :\n\n\nAs the pricing strategy plans the business  profitability,  VserveU  ensures convenient price for an end-user by providing each service with three category of packages Basic, Premium, and Standard.  Each package has their unique features such as delivery deadline, summary about package and overall cost. \n\n\nPrivacy over piracy :\n\n\nSecuring the customer data is the key for customer enhancement . VserveU ensures privacy via integrating to a secured third party payment gateway for safe & secured payment with convenient option of of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI .\n\n\nFullfillment :\n\n\nHaving a well outlined and smooth order fulfillment process will help  business continue to draw customers and satisfy them with our service. In the same way, VserveU guarantees that on time delivery of the service via receiving fulfilment from requestor.\n\n\nHandling Exception with Excellence:\n\n\nAn exceptional case of delay in delivery is  also  handled well by VServeU by opting  couple of  choices for the customer either to  seek for  refund or to opt for rescheduling the delivery date. In either way , VserveU satisfies even the unsatisfied customer via it's excellence..\n\n\nCustomer Retention:\n\n\nRetaining the customer is possible only  by serving them better every time. VserveU  focuses on customer Retention by  collecting  feedback from the customer for each service thus can improve it's service . Overall Rating is also calculated based on feedback provided, thus making it easy for the other customer to choose the best one.\n\n\nReports:\n\n\nSelf analyzation is the key to self improvement ,VserveU offers the customer, a chance to analyze  their delivery detail which includes date of delivery , type and cost of the service delivered.\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nWe built the application based on \nPega Express Methodology\n which includes discover phase, prepare phase, build phase and adopt phase.\n\n\nDiscover Phase:\n\n\nwe are the team of eight members. Each one of us  decided to play a role as scrum master, IT people, Customer and Business Architect. In this discover phase , the IT people and Business Architect work with the Customer to identify the customer journey and further we identified our end user outcome and then we understood how this related to our business outcome.\nThe customer outcome we found is, they need an application where an organization or a freelancer can create their account and provide their service details to make their business easier. And where an organization or an individual can find a needful service. \n\n\nHere we captured the three building blocks.\n\n\nMicroJourney:\n\n\n\n\nWe split the project(Journey) into smaller pieces that make up the logic and behavior of an application, to make it center-out. \n\n\nWe prioritized the Microjourney after design sprint.\n\n\nWe decided to build a Microjourney which allows a customer to register and to provide or to request a service. \n\n\nThen we broke down our Microjourney into the following processes,\n\n\n\n\nProcess to capture data from user\n\n\nProcess to save data provided by user\n\n\nProcess to create an account for an user in application\n\n\nProcess to verify and approve the details provided by the user\n\n\nProcess to handle the exceptional scenarios.\n\n\nProcess to guide the user to find the best service provider based on their requirement.\n\n\nProcess to make a payment.\n\n\nProcess to capture the fulfillment.\n\n\nProcess to provide feedback.\n\n\nProcess to create a chatbot.\n\n\nProcess to customize the default portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonas & channels:\n\nUser & Admin are the people who are going to interact with our application \nVserveU Portal and VserveU Assistant  chatbot are the channel used by our personas to interact with our application  .\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nHere we collect what all the information needs to be captured as part of the application and where it needs to be stored. Information Captured as part of application: Business type ,Provider type , Services and it\u2019s detail, Organization detail, SPOC detail, Contact detail ,Package detail ,Account detail, Feedback detail and Fulfillment detail.\n\n\nData Storage: Local data storage and Pega Data.\n\n\nAs an outcome of discover phase , we decided  go-live on April 5 2021 to achieve the outcome of our project.\n\n\nPrepare Phase:\n\n\nIn prepare phase we started with the project kick off meeting, Where we understood the \nvision, desired outcomes and plan , run shorter ideation sessions to innovate new experiences for end  user\n. We began to understand the  Microjourney from the initial \nMLP\n. During this prepare phase we used \nApp Studio\n to capture or to refine our Micro Journey. And we used \nDirectly Capture Objectives (DCO)\n discipline to capture outcomes and user stories directly into Pega.\n\nScrum:\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to use \nscrum method\n to develop our project which defines specific roles, responsibilities, events, artifacts, and processes.\n\n\nWe decided to include the following scrum events,\n\n\n\n\nStory refinement and estimation\n\n\nSprint Planning\n\n\nDaily scrum\n\n\nSprint Review \n\n\nSprint Reterospective\n\n\n\n\nWe divided our project into \ntime-boxed development cycles called  sprints\n .We had 2 Sprints in our project.(1 Sprint = 2 weeks)\n\n\nWe maintained our backlog in the form of \nuser stories\n.\n\n\nThe user stories are validated in this phase.\n\n\nWe used \nAgile Workbench to capture these user stories\n. Everyone in team can access and review as it is available on Pega cloud. In case of ay modification requested from client , It can be directly captured in pega without the use of external tool .  Usage of  any external tools may result in out of sync and and there may be a possibility of building it from scratch .It will reduce time consumption.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Phase:\n\n\nApp studio:\n\n    The case life cycle representing the end to end business process was designed using app studio. The reason behind using app studio is to utilize and leverage out of box capabilities. Based on user interaction with the application along with flow of business process we have configured flow rule(process) which consists of  steps that users need to perform to complete the business transaction and added pega automation shapes to auto perform the task. \n\n\nView of Workflow, persona and channel\n\n\n\n\nView of Registration Case life cycle\n\n\n\n\nView of Better Business case life cycle\n\n\nFollowed by creating data models to capture the information provided by  the user and created interfaces to store the data. To resolve the customer queries, Chatbot was configured using channels and Interface available in App studio, thus paved away for end user to interact with VserveU application.\n\n\nDev Studio:\n\n Dev studio was used to configure each and every steps and automations which are part of processes in the case lifecycle. We segregated our task and created branch to perform it, to not to face any conflicts and for mutual and faster development. Agile workbench was used to collaborate and to receive feedback directly in the platform using screenshots, annotations, and video capture. \n\n\n\n\nUser Story of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Of VserveU application\n\n\n\n\nBranch Quality\n\n\nCOSMOS design system was used to  provide a seamless user experience with reusable UI components that enrich the look and feel of the application Every rule was tested  with pega unit testing and test cases was created to ensure that each rule works appropriately in all environment. At the end of each Sprint, a demo of the user stories  was presented  the business people and to the customer. At end of  THE second sprint, OUR DREAM APPLICATION VSERVEU WAS DEVELOPED.\n\n\nAdoption Phase:\n\n\nIt's time to go live with our MLP Microjourneys, VserveU application is developed and ready to serve its purpose. Our journey then  proceeded with preparing the user adoption plan, clear communication and support framework with the business people. Followed by,  continuously reviewing the progress of day 1 go live plan which we created during prepare phase and finalized the go-live support arrangements.\nFinally, Performed a release retrospective and measured our outcomes.\nThen we planned our next MLP release.\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nOne of the main challenge is managing the database. Luckily We have explored Pega OOTB components  and an activity to store the customer and service  data captured from the user  and retrieve the same.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\n1. Chatbot - \"conversational Agent\":\n\n\nWe provides a Web Chatbot channel based on Pega Customer Service that can help you get started quickly with the configuration. The Web Chatbot channel consists of the most frequently used case types, such as Chat with agent, Request a statement copy, and Make Payment.\nUsing the combination of pre-defined and configurable system responses, response commands, and text analysis, the AI-powered Web Chatbot interprets the customer conversation and sends appropriate automated responses. The Web Chatbot channel's training data quickly answer customer inquiries without any intervention. After configuring the Web Chatbot channel, we deployed the chat widget on a customer-facing website using which the customers can start interacting with Pega Customer Service.\n\n\n2. Payment:\n\n\nAs third party integration is new to us , we tried to implement the Pega integration with external third party payment API for more safe and secure transaction .  Service requestor can make real time payment with an option  of CREDIT, DEBIT, NETBANKING and UPI with Faster and safer Transaction of amount. Once the payment done , payment receipt is sent to the customer via email notifications \n\n\n3. Direct Web Access:\n\n\nDirected Web Access (DWA) allows anyone accessing the World Wide Web and email to process an assignment, on a one-time or infrequent as-needed basis. This feature extends the scope and reach of our application to us throughout the enterprise, trusted customers and suppliers, and anyone else  want to obtain information from others.\nHere we implemented the DWA to view the complaint raised by the customers and provide necessary comments through an email.\n\n\n4. Cosmos:\n\n\nCosmos is a  UX toolkit, complete App Studio-configurable (low-code) front-end system for app builders. As this feature was new to us. We developed VserveU on the framework of cosmos.\nThe design system of cosmos helped our development by,\n\n\n\n\nProvide a highly consistent user experience through a systemized collection of design rules and patterns\n\n\n Speed up design and development. time.\n\n\n It offers a complete presentation layer so that applications will be more appealing to users , produce better business outcome and allow team to focus on business logic and data of an application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pega Cosmos design system helped  our team in building  highly effective applications quickly and keeps the application easily upgradeable for future releases.\n\n\nWhat we learnt\n\n\nLearning is an endless journey . We as a team have worked in Pega 8.5 for the first time provides us  great opportunity to learn many new features. \n\n\n\n\n To understand the importance of pega express delivery methodology that uses Pega's low code experience, best practices and scrum to deliver meaningful outcomes by breaking the multiple customer journey as microjourney .\n\n\n To learn how to accelerate our workflow with Cosmos UI\n\n\n To learn how to create chatbot in pega\n\n\n To explore how to make secure payment in pega integrated with third party payment gateway provider.\n\n\n To know more about DWA(Directed Web Access) that allows an external operator  to perform an assignment\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for VserveU\n\n\n1. Deploy as Mobile app :\n\n\nA well-designed application can perform tasks much faster than a website. Mobile app will be more convenient and user friendly for user to engage more on our service . So our next goal is to publish our idea as an application in play store.\n\n\n2. Delivery Tracking :\n\n\nTracking is an important one to eliminate the risk of achieving right goal at right time .In our upcoming MLP , we planned to implement this feature in more efficient way where customer can track the detail of service delivery status like order initiated, order pending and so on . \n\n\n3. Enhancing the Customer by Credit point(Kudos Point) :\n\n\nMarketing plays an main role in every business. The requestor can earn kudos points by engaging more in application. The credit    points  is monitored the admin  of vserve u application. Higher the engagement of requestor, higher his  kudos point ,which leads    to additional  benefit on next order such as free shipping ,discount in the  package, and so on\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAs per Hindu Data Team about unemployment rate during covid\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece\n\n\nCIME - Unemployment in India - A statistical Profile\n\n\nhttps://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wdlstatpdf&file=732069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt With\n\n\ncosmos-ui\npega\npega8.5\npegachatbot\npegapayment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com"
